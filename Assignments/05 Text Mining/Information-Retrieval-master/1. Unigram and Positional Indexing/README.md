# How to run?
- Extract the files
- Open the Jupyter Notebook files and make sure that the dataset is available in the same folder, and run from the beginning.
- in the end of the Notebook there is a variable query in which you can change the query string.

# Note:
- I have some additional file being created by computer due to which i am removing the first file from variable 'path". But you need not necessarily do that. Check before doing that.
- For simplicity, Pickle is used to save the postings that were generated during my test time. The already computed postings are saved in the same folder and can be loaded by skipping the running of cells manually.

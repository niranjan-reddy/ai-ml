# Covid-19-Online-Articles-Dataset
With the abundance of Covid-19 information, online media have a proactive role in shaping people's understanding and reactions towards an emerging event, such as the Covid-19 pandemic. This dataset is a collection of articles about Covid-19 published online from May 2020 to September 2020. The primary providers of these articles are 10news.com, cnn.com, and foxla.com. The keywords used to scrape the data are 'coronavirus' and 'covid-19'. About collected articles consisting of several sentences were processed and labeled as 1 (positive class) for texts with positive sentiment and 0 (negative class) for text with negative sentiment. The dataset contains two columns (text and sentiment). The text column contains text from the articles to which a label applies. The sentiment column contains either 1 or 0. The dataset has the potential to reveal opinions, sentiments, and the real impact of Covid-19 and the need to fight it head on.

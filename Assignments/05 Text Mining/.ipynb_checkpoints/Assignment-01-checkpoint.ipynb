      "\n",
      "    Mr. Rabbit sat on his front porch rocking, eating a great big carrot, \n",
      "and looking.\n",
      "\n",
      "    \"Looks like Sly Fox coming down the road,\" he said to himself, walking \n",
      "to the end of the porch. Shading his eyes with his paws, he exclaimed, \"It \n",
      "is Sly Fox.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "    \"Good morning Mr. Rabbit,\" cried Sly Fox, as he walked across the yard. \n",
      "\"Good morning,\" replied Mr. Rabbit, a slight frown on his face. \n",
      "\n",
      "    \"Well,\" said Sly Fox, \"as I haven't seen you in so long a time, thought \n",
      "I would stop and chat a while.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "    Mr. Rabbit could not be rude in his own home, even to an enemy, so he \n",
      "offered Sly Fox a seat on the porch. \n",
      "\n",
      "    \"Take a chair,\" he said politely. \tBut Sly Fox did not stay long, and as \n",
      "he was leaving, he asked: \"Mr. Rabbit, my mother is having a good dinner \n",
      "tonight. Won't you, Mrs. Rabbit, and your three little rabs come to dinner \n",
      "with me?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "    Oh, thought Mr. Rabbit, he knows about my little rabs and wants to take \n",
      "us off to eat us. He pretended to be disappointed as he replied: \"Sorry, Sly \n",
      "Fox, we have an engagement for today, but if you want us we can come \n",
      "tomorrow.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "    At this Sly Fox chuckled inwardly, and readily agreed to come for them \n",
      "the next day. Wishing Mr. Rabbit \"Good day\", he trotted on down the road \n",
      "toward his home. \n",
      "\n",
      "    As soon as he was out of sight, Mr. Rabbit ran into his house and called \n",
      "Mrs. Rabbit. \"Get all our things together,\" he said, \"and put rubber boots \n",
      "on our little rabs. We have to move quickly to the Piney Woods across the \n",
      "brook. Old Sly Fox has found our home and will destroy us.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "    In no time at all the Rabbit family had moved, and the little rabs were \n",
      "delighted with their new home. A woodland of towering pines it was, the \n",
      "ground covered with pine needles which made a soft carpeting. The wind made \n",
      "music in the pine trees, birds sang, and the fragrance of flowers filled the \n",
      "air. They found a huge hollow tree where Mr. Rabbit burrowed deep and made \n",
      "them a cozy home. Squirrels had left nuts hidden around in the old tree. \n",
      "Owls hooted throughout the night, crickets chirped merrily. \n",
      "\n",
      "    Next morning old Sly Fox knocked on the door where he had left Mr. \n",
      "Rabbit. Mrs. Hedgehog answered the door. \"Good morning, Mrs. Hedgehog. Is \n",
      "Mr. Rabbit in?\" inquired Sly Fox with a wicked grin and a cunning look in \n",
      "his eyes. \n",
      "\n",
      "    \"No,\" replied Mrs. Eedgehog, none too cordially. \"The Rabbit family \n",
      "moved to parts unknown right after you left yesterday.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "    \"Ah,\" exclaimed old Sly Fox, \"Mr. Rabbit and family were going to have \n",
      "dinner with me. My mother has planned a real feast. Why don't you come and \n",
      "enjoy it with us?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "    \"Oh,\" replied Mrs. Hedgehog, smacking her lips and thinking of all the \n",
      "goodies, \"I have just moved in and there is so much to do! Why not let it go \n",
      "until tomorrow?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "    \"Do you like nice young grasshoppers?\" asked Sly Fox softly. \n",
      "\n",
      "    \"Do I? Nothing so good as tender young grasshoppers,\" answered Mrs. \n",
      "Hedgehog, fairly dribbling at the mouth at the thought of such a dainty. \n",
      "\n",
      "    \"Well,\" said Sly Fox, \"we pass a field where there are any number of \n",
      "them. Come get in this sack, and when I stop in the field we will open the \n",
      "sack and rake in all of them we want. Mother will bake them with apples and \n",
      "they will be deilicious!\" This was too much for greedy Mrs. Hedgehog to \n",
      "resist, so in the sack she went. Sly Fox with a grin grabbed the sack, threw \n",
      "it over his shoulder and trotted toward home. \tAfter going a long way, Mrs. \n",
      "Hedgehog became suspicious and cried, \"How long before we reach that field \n",
      "of grasshoppers?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "    \"Why, you silly, greedy hedgehog, there is no field of grasshoppers for \n",
      "you. I am going to eat you for my dinner. It's you with apple dumplings that \n",
      "my mother will bake.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "    Every hair on Mrs. Hedgehog's head stood on end with fright. Oh, how \n",
      "foolish she had been! Her greed had trapped her. If only she had stayed home \n",
      "and straightened her house and cooked her own dinner, she would not have \n",
      "been in this sack to be eaten by Sly Fox. Greediness never pays, she thought \n",
      "to herself. \n",
      "\n",
      "    Sly Fox became tired, and as a slight rain had begun to fall, he looked \n",
      "for a dry place to sit down. Throwing the sack to the ground and chuckling \n",
      "at the thought of sitting on Mrs. Hedgehog, he dropped heavily upon the \n",
      "sack. \n",
      "\n",
      "    \"Wow, Wow!\" he cried, jumping quickly up, for Mrs. Hedgehog shot her \n",
      "sharp quills into him with all her might. \n",
      "\n",
      "    Sly Fox ran to and fro trying to pull out the quills, but they had gone \n",
      "too deep. Home he ran, screaming to his mother. Old Mother Fox threw him \n",
      "over a log and began pulling out the quills, at the same time calling to a \n",
      "neighbor fox to bring some honey to put on the places where the quills had \n",
      "been. \n",
      "\n",
      "    Mrs. Hedgehog crawled out of the bag and began walking slowly toward \n",
      "home. She thought to herself that never again would she be so greedy and \n",
      "allow herself to be fooled by Sly Fox or any one else. \n",
      "\n",
      "    Meanwhile, Mr. Rabbit and family were living happily in Piney Woods. The \n",
      "little rabs played on the crystal clear brook that ran through the woods, \n",
      "wading, sailing little leaf boats, and trying to catch the silvery minnows \n",
      "darting here and there. \n",
      "\n",
      "    Late one evening Papa and Mama Rabbit were sitting before the cozy fire \n",
      "talking. Papa Rabbit had on his house robe and bedroom slippers, reading the \n",
      "newspaper. Every now and then he looked over his spectacles lovingly at \n",
      "dainty little Mama Rabbit, dressed in a flowered housecoat and red slippers \n",
      "and knitting little socks for the little rabs. \n",
      "\n",
      "    \"Sniff! Sniff! Sniff!\" came suddenly to their ears. \n",
      "\n",
      "    \"Sly Fox!\" whispered Papa Rabbit, his face now full of concern and \n",
      "alarm. \n",
      "\n",
      "    \"Yes,\" agreed Mama Rabbit, her voice trembling with fright. \n",
      "\n",
      "    \"Go cover the little rabs with straw and tell them to be very, very \n",
      "quiet,\" instructed Papa Rabbit. \n",
      "\n",
      "    Mrs. Rabbit quickly covered the little rabs and cautioned them to be as \n",
      "quiet as mice. Since they were well behaved and obedient little rabs, they \n",
      "did just as their mother told them. \n",
      "\n",
      "    \"I left my big stick beside the old oak tree,\" cried Papa Rabbit under \n",
      "his breath. \"What shall we do?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "    \"Sniff! Sniff! Sniff!\" went Sly Fox again, scratching up the earth by \n",
      "the old hollow tree as he began to dig furiously. The poor little Rabbit \n",
      "family sat still and frightened, their hearts thumping, their paws shaking, \n",
      "and their eyes bulging with panic. Suddenly in the distance they heard the \n",
      "\"Toot! Toot!Toot!\" of horns, and the \"Woof! Woof! Woof!\" of barking dogs. \n",
      "\n",
      "    Papa Rabbit whispered, \"Fox hunters!\" as his heart gave a bound of \n",
      "relief. \n",
      "\n",
      "    Nearer and nearer came the baying of the hounds and the music of the \n",
      "horns. Old Sly Fox was so busily digging that he failed to hear at first, \n",
      "but suddenly he stopped digging, and threw back his ears to listen. Then he \n",
      "quickly jumped away from the log where the Rabbit family lived and started \n",
      "running. \n",
      "\n",
      "    But the hounds were right after him, baying loudly with all their might. \n",
      "The horses' feet beat out an excited rhythm as the red-coated fox hunters \n",
      "urged them on in the chase. Up hill, over the meadows they ran. \n",
      "\n",
      "    Sly Fox was now running for his life, but the dogs were getting closer \n",
      "and closer. He jumped across the brook and spied a hole among some bushes. \n",
      "Into this he slid, and as the dogs went down the side of the stream of water \n",
      "before they jumped across they lost his scent. Sly Fox quickly ran out of \n",
      "the hole and took off in the opposite direction from the way the dogs were \n",
      "going. He had been so frightened and so near death that he resolved to \n",
      "himself never to bother the Rabbit family again. \n",
      "\n",
      "    Meanwhile, when Papa Rabbit had heard the hounds start the chase, he \n",
      "turned to Mama Rabbit and cried, \"Safe at last! Call our little rabs for \n",
      "prayers of thanksgiving and praise to our Father which art in heaven.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "    After prayers, Mama Rabbit hustled about making mint tea for her and \n",
      "Papa Rabbit, and hot chocolate piled high with whipped cream for the little \n",
      "rabs. After that time they Lived happily among the great whispering pines, \n",
      "never bothered by old Sly Fox.\n",

      "Holmes opened quite so abruptly, or so dramatically, as that\n",
      "which I associate with The Three Gables. I had not seen Holmes\n",
      "for some days and had no idea of the new channel into which his\n",
      "activities had been directed. He was in a chatty mood that\n",
      "morning, however, and had just settled me into the well-worn\n",
      "low armchair on one side of the fire, while he had curled down\n",
      "with his pipe in his mouth upon the opposite chair, when our\n",
      "visitor arrived. If I had said that a mad bull had arrived it would\n",
      "give a clearer impression of what occurred.\n",
      "  The door had flown open and a huge negro had burst into the\n",
      "room. He would have been a comic figure if he had not been\n",
      "terrific, for he was dressed in a very loud gray check suit with a\n",
      "flowing salmon-coloured tie. His broad face and flattened nose\n",
      "were thrust forward, as his sullen dark eyes, with a smouldering\n",
      "gleam of malice in them, turned from one of us to the other.\n",
      "  \"Which of you gen'l'men is Masser Holmes?\" he asked.\n",
      "  Holmes raised his pipe with a languid smile.\n",
      "  \"Oh! it's you, is it?\" said our visitor, coming with an un-\n",
      "pleasant, stealthy step round the angle of the table. \"See here,\n",

      "damn fine if I have to trim you up a bit. I've handled your kind\n",
      "before now, and they didn't look fine when I was through with\n",
      "them. Look at that, Masser Holmes!\"\n",
      "  He swung a huge knotted lump of a fist under my friend's\n",
      "nose. Holmes examined it closely with an air of great interest.\n",
      "  \"Were you born so?\" he asked. \"Or did it come by degrees?\"\n",
      "  It may have been the icy coolness of my friend, or it may have\n",
      "been the slight clatter which I made as I picked up the poker. In\n",
      "any case, our visitor's manner became less flamboyant.\n",

      "be on hand also. Don't you forget it.\"\n",
      "  \"I've wanted to meet you for some time,\" said Holmes. \"I\n",

      "  A short railway journey, and a shorter drive, brought us to the\n",
      "house, a brick and timber villa, standing in its own acre of\n",
      "undeveloped grassland. Three small projections above. the upper\n",
      "windows made a feeble attempt to justify its name. Behind was a\n",
      "grove of melancholy, half-grown pines, and the whole aspect of\n",
      "the place was poor and depressing. None the less, we found the\n",
      "house to be well furnished, and the lady who received us was a\n",

      "  \"Dr. Watson and I are at your service.\"\n",
      "  \"There have been some very strange happenings. I have been\n",
      "in this house more than a year now, and as I wished to lead a\n",
      "retired life I have seen little of my neighbours. Three days ago I\n",
      "had a call from a man who said that he was a house agent. He\n",
      "said that this house would exactly suit a client of his, and that if I\n",
      "would part with it money would be no object. It seemed to me\n",
      "very strange as there are several empty houses on the market\n",
      "which appear to be equally eligible, but naturally I was interested\n",
      "in what he said. I therefore named a price which was five\n",
      "hundred pounds more than I gave. He at once closed with the\n",
      "offer, but added that his client desired to buy the furniture as\n",
      "well and would I put a price upon it. Some of this furniture is\n",
      "from my old home, and it is, as you see, very good, so that I\n",
      "named a good round sum. To this also he at once agreed. I had\n",
      "always wanted to travel, and the bargain was so good a one that\n",
      "it really seemed that I should be my own mistress for the rest of\n",
      "my life.\n",
      "  \"Yesterday the man arrived with the agreement all drawn out.\n",
      "Luckily I showed it to Mr. Sutro, my lawyer, who lives in\n",
      "Harrow. He said to me, 'This is a very strange document. Are\n",
      "you aware that if you sign it you could not legally take anything\n",
      "out of the house -- not even your own private possessions?' When\n",
      "the man came again in the evening I pointed this out, and I said\n",
      "that I meant only to sell the furniture.\n",
      "  \" 'No, no, everything,' said he.\n",
      "  \" 'But my clothes? My jewels?'\n",
      "  \" 'Well, well, some concession might be made for your per-\n",
      "sonal effects. But nothing shall go out of the house unchecked.\n",
      "My client is a very liberal man, but he has his fads and his own\n",
      "way of doing things. It is everything or nothing with him.'\n",
      "  \" 'Then it must be nothing,' said I. And there the matter was\n",
      "left, but the whole thing seemed to me to be so unusual that I\n",
      "thought --\"\n",
      "  Here we had a very extraordinary interruption.\n",
      "  Holmes raised his hand for silence. Then he strode across the\n",
      "room, flung open the door, and dragged in a great gaunt woman\n",
      "whom he had seized by the shoulder. She entered with ungainly\n",
      "struggle like some huge awkward chicken, torn, squawking, out\n",
      "of its coop.\n",
      "  \"Leave me alone! What are you a-doin' of?\" she screeched.\n",
      "  \"Why, Susan, what is this?\"\n",
      "  \"Well, ma'am, I was comin' in to ask if the visitors was\n",
      "stayin' for lunch when this man jumped out at me.\"\n",
      "  \"I have been listening to her for the last five minutes, but did\n",
      "not wish to interrupt your most interesting narrative. Just a little\n",
      "wheezy, Susan, are you not? You breathe too heavily for that\n",
      "kind of work.\"\n",
      "  Susan turned a sulky but amazed face upon her captor. \"Who\n",
      "be you, anyhow, and what right have you a-pullin' me about like\n",
      "this?\"\n",
      "  \"It was merely that I wished to ask a question in your\n",
      "presence. Did you, Mrs. Maberley, mention to anyone that you\n",
      "were going to write to me and consult me?\"\n",
      "  \"No, Mr. Holmes, I did not.\"\n",
      "  \"Who posted your letter?\"\n",
      "  \"Susan did.\"\n",
      "  \"Exactly. Now, Susan, to whom was it that you wrote or sent\n",
      "a message to say that your mistress was asking advice from\n",
      "me?\"\n",
      "  \"It's a lie. I sent no message.\"\n",
      "  \"Now, Susan, wheezy people may not live long, you know.\n",
      "It's a wicked thing to tell fibs. Whom did you tell?\"\n",
      "  \"Susan!\" cried her mistress, \"I believe you are a bad, treach-\n",
      "erous woman. I remember now that I saw you speaking to\n",
      "someone over the hedge.\"\n",
      "  \"That was my own business,\" said the woman sullenly.\n",
      "  \"Suppose I tell you that it was Barney Stockdale to whom you\n",
      "spoke?\" said Holmes.\n",
      "  \"Well, if you know, what do you want to ask for?\"\n",
      "  \"I was not sure, but I know now. Well now, Susan, it will be\n",
      "worth ten pounds to you if you will tell me who is at the back of\n",
      "Barney.\"\n",
      "  \"Someone that could lay down a thousand pounds for every\n",
      "ten you have in the world.\"\n",
      "  \"So, a rich man? No; you smiled -- a rich woman. Now we\n",
      "have got so far, you may as well give the name and earn the\n",
      "tenner.\"\n",
      "  \"I'll see you in hell first.\"\n",
      "  \"Oh, Susan! Language!\"\n",
      "  \"I am clearing out of here. I've had enough of you all. I'll\n",
      "send for my box to-morrow.\" She flounced for the door.\n",
      "  \"Good-bye, Susan. Paregoric is the stuff.... Now,\" he\n",
      "continued, turning suddenly from lively to severe when the door\n",
      "had closed behind the flushed and angry woman, \"this gang\n",
      "means business. Look how close they play the game. Your letter\n",
      "to me had the 10 P.M. postmark. And yet Susan passes the word\n",
      "to Barney. Barney has time to go to his employer and get\n",
      "instructions; he or she -- I incline to the latter from Susan's grin\n",
      "when she thought I had blundered -- forms a plan. Black Steve is\n",
      "called in, and I am warned off by eleven o'clock next morning.\n",
      "That's quick work, you know.\"\n",
      "  \"But what do they want?\"\n",
      "  \"Yes, that's the question. Who had the house before you?\"\n",
      "  \"A retired sea captain called Ferguson.\"\n",
      "  \"Anything remarkable about him?\"\n",
      "  \"Not that ever I heard of.\"\n",
      "  \"I was wondering whether he could have buried something.\n",
      "Of course, when people bury treasure nowadays they do it in the\n",
      "Post-Office bank. But there are always some lunatics about. It\n",
      "would be a dull world without them. At first I thought of some\n",
      "buried valuable. But why, in that case, should they want your\n",
      "furniture? You don't happen to have a Raphael or a first folio\n",
      "Shakespeare without knowing it?\"\n",
      "  \"No, I don't think I have anything rarer than a Crown Derby\n",
      "tea-set.\"\n",
      "  \"That would hardly justify all this mystery. Besides, why\n",
      "should they not openly state what they want? If they covet your\n",
      "tea-set, they can surely offer a price for it without buying you\n",
      "out, lock, stock, and barrel. No, as I read it, there is something\n",
      "which you do not know that you have, and which you would not\n",
      "give up if you did know.\"\n",
      "  \"That is how I read it,\" said I.\n",
      "  \"Dr. Watson agrees, so that settles it.\"\n",
      "  \"Well, Mr. Holmes, what can it be?\"\n",
      "  \"Let us see whether by this purely mental analysis we can get\n",
      "it to a finer point. You have been in this house a year.\"\n",
      "  \"Nearly two.\"\n",
      "  \"All the better. During this long period no one wants anything\n",
      "from you. Now suddenly within three or four days you have\n",
      "urgent demands. What would you gather from that?\"\n",
      "  \"It can only mean,\" said I, \"that the object, whatever it may\n",
      "be, has only just come into the house.\"\n",
      "  \"Settled once again,\" said Holmes. \"Now, Mrs. Maberley\n",
      "has any object just arrived?\"\n",
      "  \"No, I have bought nothing new this year.\"\n",
      "  \"Indeed! That is very remarkable. Well, I think we had best\n",
      "let matters develop a little further until we have clearer data. Is\n",
      "that lawyer of yours a capable man?\"\n",
      "  \"Mr. Sutro is most capable.\"\n",
      "  \"Have you another maid, or was the fair Susan, who has just\n",
      "banged your front door alone?\"\n",
      "  \"I have a young girl.\"\n",
      "  \"Try and get Sutro to spend a night or two in the house. You\n",
      "might possibly want protection.\"\n",
      "  \"Against whom?\"\n",
      "  \"Who knows? The matter is certainly obscure. If I can't find\n",
      "what they are after, I must approach the matter from the other\n",
      "end and try to get at the principal. Did this house-agent man give\n",
      "any address?\"\n",
      "  \"Simply his card and occupation. Haines-Johnson, Auctioneer\n",
      "and Valuer.\"\n",
      "  \"I don't think we shall find him in the directory. Honest\n",
      "business men don't conceal their place of business. Well, you\n",
      "will let me know any fresh development. I have taken up your\n",
      "case, and you may rely upon it that I shall see it through.\"\n",
      "  As we passed through the hall Holmes's eyes, which missed\n",
      "nothing, lighted upon several trunks and cases which were piled\n",
      "in a corner. The labels shone out upon them.\n",
      "  \" 'Milano.' 'Lucerne.' These are from Italy.\"\n",
      "  \"They are poor Douglas's things.\"\n",
      "  \"You have not unpacked them? How long have you had\n",
      "them?\"\n",
      "  \"They arrived last week.\"\n",
      "  \"But you said -- why, surely this might be the missing link.\n",
      "How do we know that there is not something of value there?\"\n",
      "  \"There could not possibly be, Mr. Holmes. Poor Douglas had\n",
      "only his pay and a small annuity. What could he have of value?\"\n",
      "  Holmes was lost in thought.\n",
      "  \"Delay no longer, Mrs. Maberley,\" he said at last. \"Have\n",
      "these things taken upstairs to your bedroom. Examine them as\n",
      "soon as possible and see what they cohtain. I will come to-\n",
      "morrow and hear your report.\"\n",
      "  It was quite evident that The Three Gables was under very\n",
      "close surveillance, for as we came round the high hedge at the\n",
      "end of the lane there was the negro prize-fighter standing in the\n",
      "shadow. We came on him quite suddenly, and a grim and\n",
      "menacing figure he looked in that lonely place. Holmes clapped\n",
      "his hand to his pocket.\n",
      "  \"Lookin' for your gun, Masser Holmes?\"\n",
      "  \"No, for my scent-bottle, Steve.\"\n",
      "  \"You are funny, Masser Holmes, ain't you?\"\n",
      "  \"It won't be funny for you, Steve, if I get after you. I gave\n",
      "you fair warning this morning.\"\n",
      "  \"Well, Masser Holmes, I done gone think over what you said,\n",
      "and I don't want no more talk about that affair of Masser\n",
      "Perkins. S'pose I can help you, Masser Holmes, I will.\"\n",
      "  \"Well, then, tell me who is behind you on this job.\"\n",
      "  \"So help me the Lord! Masser Holmes, I told you the truth\n",
      "before. I don't know. My boss Barney gives me orders and that's\n",
      "all.\"\n",
      "  \"Well, just bear in mind, Steve, that the lady in that house,\n",
      "and everything under that roof, is under my protection. Don't\n",
      "forget it.\"\n",
      "  \"All right, Masser Holmes. I'll remember.\"\n",
      "  \"I've got him thoroughly frightened for his own skin, Wat-\n",
      "son,\" Holmes remarked as we walked on. \"I think he would\n",
      "double-cross his employer if he knew who he was. It was lucky I\n",
      "had some knowledge of the Spencer John crowd, and that Steve\n",
      "was one of them. Now, Watson, this is a case for Langdale Pike,\n",
      "and I am going to see him now. When I get back I may be\n",
      "clearer in the matter.\"\n",
      "  I saw no more of Holmes during the day, but I could well\n",
      "imagine how he spent it, for Langdale Pike was his human\n",
      "book of reference upon all matters of social scandal. This\n",
      "strange, languid creature spent his waking hours in the bow\n",
      "window of a St. James's Street club and was the receiving-\n",
      "station as well as the transmitter for all the gossip of the\n",
      "metropolis. He made, it was said, a four-figure income by\n",
      "the paragraphs which he contributed every week to the gar-\n",
      "bage papers which cater to an inquisitive public. If ever, far\n",
      "down in the turbid depths of London life, there was some\n",
      "strange swirl or eddy, it was marked with automatic exact-\n",
      "ness by this human dial upon the surface. Holmes discreetly\n",
      "helped Langdale to knowledge, and on occasion was helped in\n",
      "turn.\n",
      "  When I met my friend in his room early next morning, I was\n",
      "conscious from his bearing that all was well, but none the less a\n",
      "most unpleasant surprise was awaiting us. It took the shape of\n",
      "the following telegram.\n",
      "\n",
      "       Please come out at once. Client's house burgled in the\n",
      "     night. Police in possession.\n",
      "                           SUTRO.\n",
      "  Holmes whistled. \"The drama has come to a crisis, and\n",
      "quicker than I had expected. There is a great driving-power at\n",
      "the back of this business, Watson, which does not surprise me\n",
      "after what I have heard. This Sutro, of course, is her lawyer. I\n",
      "made a mistake, I fear, in not asking you to spend the night on\n",
      "guard. This fellow has clearly proved a broken reed. Well, there\n",
      "is nothing for it but another journey to Harrow Weald.\"\n",
      "  We found The Three Gables a very different establishment to\n",
      "the orderly household of the previous day. A small group of\n",
      "idlers had assembled at the garden gate, while a couple of\n",
      "constables were examining the windows and the geranium beds.\n",
      "Within we met a gray old gentleman, who introduced himself as\n",
      "the lawyer together with a bustling, rubicund inspector, who\n",
      "greeted Hoimes as an old friend.\n",
      "  \"Well, Mr. Holmes, no chance for you in this case, I'm\n",
      "afraid. Just a common, ordinary burglary, and well within the\n",
      "capacity of the poor old police. No experts need apply.\"\n",
      "  \"I am sure the case is in very good hands,\" said Holmes.\n",
      "\"Merely a common burglary, you say?\"\n",
      "  \"Quite so. We know pretty well who the men are and where\n",
      "to find them. It is that gang of Barney Stockdale, with the big\n",
      "nigger in it -- they've been seen about here.\"\n",
      "  \"Excellent! What did they get?\"\n",
      "  \"Well, they don't seem to have got much. Mrs. Maberley was\n",
      "chloroformed and the house was -- Ah! here is the lady herself.\"\n",
      "  Our friend of yesterday, looking very pale and ill, had entered\n",
      "the room, leaning upon a little maidservant.\n",
      "  \"You gave me good advice, Mr. Holmes,\" said she, smiling\n",
      "ruefully. \"Alas, I did not take it! I did not wish to trouble Mr.\n",
      "Sutro, and so I was unprotected.\"\n",
      "  \"I only heard of it this morning,\" the lawyer explained.\n",
      "  \"Mr. Holmes advised me to have some friend in the house. I\n",
      "neglected his advice, and I have paid for it.\"\n",
      "  \"You look wretchedly ill,\" said Holmes. \"Perhaps you are\n",
      "hardly equal to telling me what occurred.\"\n",
      "  \"It is all here,\" said the inspector, tapping a bulky notebook.\n",
      "  \"Still, if the lady is not too exhausted --\"\n",
      "  \"There is really so little to tell. I have no doubt that wicked\n",
      "Susan had planned an entrance for them. They must have known\n",
      "the house to an inch. I was conscious for a moment of the\n",
      "chloroform rag which was thrust over my mouth, but I have no\n",
      "notion how long I may have been senseless. When I woke, one\n",
      "man was at the bedside and another was rising with a bundle in\n",
      "his hand from among my son's baggage, which was partially\n",
      "opened and littered over the floor. Before he could get away I\n",
      "sprang up and seized him.\"\n",
      "  \"You took a big risk,\" said the inspector.\n",
      "  \"I clung to him, but he shook me off, and the other may have\n",
      "struck me, for I can remember no more. Mary the maid heard the\n",
      "noise and began screaming out of the window. That brought the\n",
      "police, but the rascals had got away.\"\n",
      "  \"What did they take?\"\n",
      "  \"Well, I don't think there is anything of value missing. I am\n",
      "sure there was nothing in my son's trunks.\"\n",
      "  \"Did the men leave no clue?\"\n",
      "  \"There was one sheet of paper which I may have torn from\n",
      "the man that I grasped. It was lying all crumpled on the floor. It\n",
      "is in my son's handwriting.\"\n",
      "  \"Which means that it is not of much use,\" said the inspector.\n",
      "\"Now if it had been in the burglar's --\"\n",
      "  \"Exactly,\" said Holmes. \"What rugged common sense! None\n",
      "the less, I should be curious to see it.\"\n",
      "  The inspector drew a folded sheet of foolscap from his\n",
      "pocketbook.\n",
      "  \"I never pass anything, however trifling,\" said he with some\n",
      "pomposity. \"That is my advice to you, Mr. Holmes. In twenty-\n",
      "five years' experience I have learned my lesson. There is always\n",
      "the chance of finger-marks or something.\"\n",
      "  Holmes inspected the sheet of paper.\n",
      "  \"What do you make of it, Inspector?\"\n",
      "  \"Seems to be the end of some queer novel, so far as I can\n",
      "see.\"\n",
      "  \"It may certainly prove to be the end of a queer tale,\" said\n",
      "Holmes. \"You have noticed the number on the top of the page.\n",
      "It is two hundred and forty-five. Where are the odd two hundred\n",
      "and forty-four pages?\"\n",
      "  \"Well, I suppose the burglars got those. Much good may it do\n",
      "them!\"\n",
      "  \"It seems a queer thing to break into a house in order to steal\n",
      "such papers as that. Does it suggest anything to you, Inspector?\"\n",
      "  \"Yes, sir, it suggests that in their hurry the rascals just\n",
      "grabbed at what came first to hand. I wish them joy of what they\n",
      "got.\"\n",
      "  \"Why should they go to my son's things?\" asked Mrs.\n",
      "Maberley.\n",
      "  \"Well, they found nothing valuable downstairs, so they tried\n",
      "their luck upstairs. That is how I read it. What do you make of\n",
      "it, Mr. Holmes?\"\n",
      "  \"I must think it over, Inspector. Come to the window, Wat-\n",
      "son.\" Then, as we stood together, he read over the fragment of\n",
      "paper. It began in the middle of a sentence and ran like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "       \". . . face bled considerably from the cuts and blows,\n",
      "     but it was nothing to the bleeding of his heart as he saw that\n",
      "     lovely face, the face for which he had been prepared to\n",
      "     sacrifice his very life, looking out at his agony and humilia-\n",
      "     tion. She smiled -- yes, by Heaven! she smiled, like the\n",
      "     heartless fiend she was, as he looked up at her. It was at\n",
      "     that moment that love died and hate was born. Man must\n",
      "     live for something. If it is not for your embrace, my lady,\n",
      "     then it shall surely be for your undoing and my complete\n",
      "     revenge.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"Queer grammar!\" said Holmes with a smile as he handed the\n",
      "paper back to the inspector. \"Did you notice how the 'he'\n",
      "suddenly changed to 'my'? The writer was so carried away by\n",
      "his own story that he imagined himself at the supreme moment to\n",
      "be the hero.\"\n",
      "  \"It seemed mighty poor stuff,\" said the inspector as he re-\n",
      "placed it in his book. \"What! are you off, Mr. Holmes?\"\n",
      "  \"I don't think there is anything more for me to do now that\n",
      "the case is in such capable hands. By the way, Mrs. Maberley,\n",
      "did you say you wished to travel?\"\n",
      "  \"It has always been my dream, Mr. Holmes.\"\n",
      "  \"Where would you like to go -- Cairo, Madeira, the Riviera?\"\n",
      "  \"Oh if I had the money I would go round the world.\"\n",
      "  \"Quite so. Round the world. Well, good-morning. I may drop\n",
      "you a line in the evening.\" As we passed the window I caught a\n",
      "glimpse of the inspector's smile and shake of the head. \"These\n",
      "clever fellows have always a touch of madness.\" That was what\n",
      "I read in the inspector's smile.\n",
      "  \"Now, Watson, we are at the last lap of our little journey,\"\n",
      "said Holmes when we were back in the roar of central London\n",
      "once more. \"I think we had best clear the matter up at once, and\n",
      "it would be well that you should come with me, for it is safer to\n",
      "have a witness when you are dealing with such a lady as Isadora\n",
      "Klein.\"\n",
      "  We had taken a cab and were speeding to some address in\n",
      "Grosvenor Square. Holmes had been sunk in thought, but he\n",
      "roused himself suddenly.\n",

      "  \"No, I can't say that I do. I only gather that we are going to\n",

      "  \"Exactly! But does the name Isadora Klein convey nothing to\n",
      "you? She was, of course, the celebrated beauty. There was never\n",
      "a woman to touch her. She is pure Spanish, the real blood of the\n",
      "masterfui Conquistadors, and her people have been leaders in\n",
      "Pernambuco for generations. She married the aged German sugar\n",
      "king, Klein, and presently found herself the richest as well as the\n",
      "most lovely widow upon earth. Then there was an interval of\n",
      "adventure when she pleased her own tastes. She had several\n",
      "lovers, and Douglas Maberley, one of the most striking men in\n",
      "London, was one of them. It was by all accounts more than an\n",
      "adventure with him. He was not a society butterfly but a strong,\n",
      "proud man who gave and expected all. But she is the 'belle dame\n",
      "sans merci' of fiction. When her caprice is satisfied the matter is\n",
      "ended, and if the other party in the matter can't take her word\n",
      "for it she knows how to bring it home to him.\"\n",
      "  \"Then that was his own story --\"\n",
      "  \"Ah! you are piecing it together now. I hear that she is about\n",
      "to marry the young Duke of Lomond, who might almost be her\n",
      "son. His Grace's ma might overlook the age, but a big scandal\n",
      "would be a different matter, so it is imperative -- Ah! here we\n",

      "  It was one of the finest corner-houses of the West End. A\n",

      "  The machine broke down.\n",
      "  \"Not at home means not at home to you,\" said the footman.\n",
      "  \"Good,\" Holmes answered. \"That means that we shall not\n",
      "have to wait. Kindly give this note to your mistress.\"\n",
      "  He scribbled three or four words upon a sheet of his notebook,\n",
      "folded it, and handed it to the man.\n",

      "  \"I simply wrote: 'Shall it be the police, then?' I think that\n",
      "should pass us in.\"\n",

      "lady had come, I felt, to that time of life when even the proudest\n",
      "beauty finds the half light more welcome. She rose from a settee\n",
      "as we entered: tall, queenly, a perfect figure, a lovely mask-like\n",
      "face, with two wonderful Spanish eyes which looked murder at\n",
      "us both.\n",
      "  \"What is this intrusion -- and this insulting message?\" she\n",
      "asked, holding up the slip of paper.\n",
      "  \"I need not explain, madame. I have too much respect for\n",
      "your intelligence to do so -- though I confess that intelligence has\n",

      "                  THE THREE LITTLE PIGS\n",
      "\n",
      "   Once upon a time . . . there were three little pigs, who left their mummy\n",
      "and daddy to see the world.\n",
      "   All summer long, they roamed through the woods and over the plains,playing\n",
      "games and having fun. None were happier than the three little pigs, and they\n",
      "easily made friends with everyone. Wherever they went, they were given a warm \n",
      "welcome, but as summer drew to a close, they realized that folk were drifting\n",
      "back to their usual jobs, and preparing for winter. Autumn came and it began\n",
      "to rain. The three little pigs started to feel they needed a real home. Sadly\n",
      "they knew that the fun was over now and they must set to work like the others,\n",
      "or they'd be left in the cold and rain, with no roof over their heads. They\n",
      "talked about what to do, but each decided for himself. The laziest little pig\n",
      "said he'd build a straw hut.\n",
      "   \"It wlll only take a day,' he said. The others disagreed.\n",
      "   \"It's too fragile,\" they said disapprovingly, but he refused to listen. Not\n",
      "quite so lazy, the second little pig went in search of planks of seasoned\n",
      "wood.\n",
      "   \"Clunk! Clunk! Clunk!\" It took him two days to nail them together. But the\n",
      "third little pig did not like the wooden house.\n",
      "   \"That's not the way to build a house!\" he said. \"It takes time, patience \n",
      "and hard work to buiid a house that is strong enough to stand up to wind, \n",
      "rain, and snow, and most of all, protect us from the wolf!\"\n",
      "   The days went by, and the wisest little pig's house took shape, brick by\n",
      "brick. From time to time, his brothers visited him, saying with a chuckle:\n",
      "   \"Why are you working so hard? Why don't you come and play?\" But the\n",
      "stubborn bricklayer pig just said \"no\".\n",
      "   \"I shall finish my house first. It must be solid and sturdy. And then I'll\n",
      "come and play!\" he said. \"I shall not be foolish like you! For he who laughs\n",
      "last, laughs longest!\"\n",
      "   It was the wisest little pig that found the tracks of a big wolf in the\n",
      "neighbourhood.\n",
      "   The little pigs rushed home in alarm. Along came the wolf, scowling \n",
      "fiercely at the laziest pig's straw hut.\n",
      "   \"Come out!\" ordered the wolf, his mouth watering. I want to speak to you!\"\n",
      "   \"I'd rather stay where I am!\" replied the little pig in a tiny voice.\n",
      "   \"I'll make you come out!\" growled the wolf angrily, and puffing out his\n",
      "chest, he took a very deep breath. Then he blew wlth all his might, right onto\n",
      "the house. And all the straw the silly pig had heaped against some thin poles,\n",
      "fell down in the great blast. Excited by his own cleverness, the wolf did not\n",
      "notice that the little pig had slithered out from underneath the heap of\n",
      "straw, and was dashing towards his brother's wooden house. When he realized \n",
      "that the little pig was escaping, the wolf grew wild with rage.\n",
      "   \"Come back!\" he roared, trying to catch the pig as he ran into the wooden \n",
      "house. The other little pig greeted his brother, shaking like a leaf.\n",
      "   \"I hope this house won't fall down! Let's lean against the door so he can't\n",
      "break in!\"\n",
      "   Outside, the wolf could hear the little pigs' words. Starving as he was, at\n",
      "the idea of a two-course meal, he rained blows on the door.\n",
      "   \"Open up! Open up! I only want to speak to you!\"\n",
      "   Inside, the two brothers wept in fear and did their best to hold the door\n",
      "fast against the blows. Then the furious wolf braced himself a new effort: he\n",
      "drew in a really enormous breath, and went ... WHOOOOO! The wooden house\n",
      "collapsed like a pack of cards.\n",
      "   Luckily, the wisest little pig had been watching the scene from the window\n",
      "of his own brick house, and he rapidly opened the door to his fleeing \n",
      "brothers. And not a moment too soon, for the wolf was already hammering \n",
      "furiously on the door. This time, the wolf had grave doubts. This house had a\n",
      "much more solid air than the others. He blew once, he blew again and then for\n",
      "a third time. But all was in vain. For the house did not budge an lnch. The\n",
      "three little pigs watched him and their fear began to fade. Quite exhausted by\n",
      "his efforts, the wolf decided to try one of his tricks. He scrambled up a\n",
      "nearby ladder, on to the roof to have a look at the chimney. However, the\n",
      "wisest little pig had seen thls ploy, and he quickly said:\n",
      "   \"Quick! Light the fire!\" With his long legs thrust down the chimney, the\n",
      "wolf was not sure if he should slide down the black hole. It wouldn'tbe easy\n",
      "to get in, but the sound of the little pigs' voices below only made him feel\n",
      "hungrier.\n",
      "   \"I'm dying of hunger! I'm goin to try and get down.\" And he let himself \n",
      "drop. But landing was rather hot, too hot! The wolf landed in the fire, stunned\n",
      "by his fall.\n",
      "   The flames licked his hairy coat and his tail became a flaring torch.\n",
      "   \"Never again! Never again will I go down a chimneyl\" he squealed, as he\n",
      "tried to put out the flames in his tail. Then he ran away as fast as he could.\n",
      "   The three happy little pigs, dancing round and round the yard, began to \n",
      "sing:\n",
      "   \"Tra-la-la! Tra-la-la! The wicked black wolf will never come back...!\"\n",
      "   From that terrible day on, the wisest little pig's brothers set to work\n",
      "with a will. In less than no time, up went the two new brick houses. The wolf\n",
      "did return once to roam in the neighbourhood, but when he caught sight of\n",
      "three chimneys, he remembered the terrible pain of a burnt tail, and he left\n",
      "for good.\n",
      "   Now safe and happy, the wisest little pig called to his brothers:\n",
      "   \"No more work! Come on, let's go and play!\"\n",

      "some weeks in one of our great university towns, and it was\n",
      "during this time that the small but instructive adventure which I\n",
      "am about to relate befell us. It will be obvious that any details\n",

      "an uncomfortable man. He shrugged his shoulders in ungracious\n",
      "acquiescence, while our visitor in hurried words and with much\n",
      "excitable gesticulation poured forth his story.\n",
      "  \"I must explain to you, Mr. Holmes, that to-morrow is the\n",
      "first day of the examination for the Fortescue Scholarship. I am\n",
      "one of the examiners. My subject is Greek, and the first of the\n",
      "papers consists of a large passage of Greek translation which the\n",
      "candidate has not seen. This passage is printed on the examina-\n",
      "tion paper, and it would naturally be an immense advantage if\n",
      "the candidate could prepare it in advance. For this reason, great\n",
      "care is taken to keep the paper secret.\n",
      "  \"To-day, about three o'clock, the proofs of this paper arrived\n",

      "For an instant I imagined that I had left my own there, but on\n",
      "feeling in my pocket I found that it was all right. The only\n",

      "slips. I had left them all together. Now, I found that one of them\n",
      "was lying on the floor, one was on the side table near the\n",
      "window, and the third was where I had left it.\"\n",
      "  Holmes stirred for the first time.\n",
      "  \"The first page on the floor, the second in the window, the\n",
      "third where you left it,\" said he.\n",
      "  \"Exactly, Mr. Holmes. You amaze me. How could you possi-\n",
      "bly know that?\"\n",
      "  \"Pray continue your very interesting statement.\"\n",
      "  \"For an instant I imagined that Bannister had taken the unpar-\n",
      "donable liberty of examining my papers. He denied it, however,\n",
      "with the utmost earnestness, and I am convinced that he was\n",
      "speaking the truth. The alternative was that someone passing had\n",
      "observed the key in the door, had known that I was out, and had\n",
      "entered to look at the papers. A large sum of money is at stake,\n",
      "for the scholarship is a very valuable one, and an unscrupulous\n",
      "man might very well run a risk in order to gain an advantage\n",
      "over his fellows.\n",
      "  \"Bannister was very much upset by the incident. He had\n",
      "nearly fainted when we found that the papers had undoubtedly\n",
      "been tampered with. I gave him a little brandy and left him\n",
      "collapsed in a chair, while I made a most careful examination of\n",
      "the room. I soon saw that the intruder had left other traces of his\n",
      "presence besides the rumpled papers. On the table in the window\n",
      "were several shreds from a pencil which had been sharpened. A\n",
      "broken tip of lead was lying there also. Evidently the rascal had\n",
      "copied the paper in a great hurry, had broken his pencil, and had\n",
      "been compelled to put a fresh point to it.\"\n",
      "  \"Excellent!\" said Holmes, who was recovering his good-\n",
      "humour as his attention became more engrossed by the case.\n",
      "\"Fortune has been your friend.\"\n",
      "  \"This was not all. I have a new writing-table with a fine\n",
      "surface of red leather. I am prepared to swear, and so is Bannis-\n",
      "ter, that it was smooth and unstained. Now I found a clean cut in\n",
      "it about three inches long -- not a mere scratch, but a positive cut.\n",
      "Not only this, but on the table I found a small ball of black\n",
      "dough or clay, with specks of something which looks like saw-\n",
      "dust in it. I am convinced that these marks were left by the man\n",
      "who rifled the papers. There were no footmarks and no other\n",
      "evidence as to his identity. I was at my wit's end, when suddenly\n",
      "the happy thought occurred to me that you were in the town, and\n",
      "I came straight round to put the matter into your hands. Do help\n",
      "me, Mr. Holmes. You see my dilemma. Either I must find the\n",
      "man or else the examination must be postponed until fresh papers\n",
      "are prepared, and since this cannot be done without explanation,\n",
      "there will ensue a hideous scandal, which will throw a cloud not\n",
      "only on the college, but on the university. Above all things, I\n",
      "desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly.\"\n",
      "  \"I shall be happy to look into it and to give you such advice\n",
      "as I can,\" said Holmes, rising and putting on his overcoat.\n",
      "\"The case is not entirely devoid of interest. Had anyone visited\n",
      "you in your room after the papers came to you?\"\n",
      "  \"Yes, young Daulat Ras, an Indian student, who lives on the\n",
      "same stair, came in to ask me some particulars about the exami-\n",
      "nation.\"\n",
      "  \"For which he was entered?\"\n",
      "  \"Yes.\"\n",
      "  \"And the papers were on your table?\"\n",
      "  \"To the best of my belief, they were rolled up.\"\n",
      "  \"But might be recognized as proofs?\"\n",
      "  \"Possibly.\"\n",
      "  \"No one else in your room?\"\n",
      "  \"No.\"\n",
      "  \"Did anyone know that these proofs would be there?\"\n",
      "  \"No one save the printer.\"\n",
      "  \"Did this man Bannister know?\"\n",
      "  \"No, certainly not. No one knew.\"\n",
      "  \"Where is Bannister now?\"\n",
      "  \"He was very ill, poor fellow. I left him collapsed in the\n",
      "chair. I was in such a hurry to come to you.\"\n",
      "  \"You left your door open?\"\n",
      "  \"I locked up the papers first.\"\n",
      "  \"Then it amounts to this, Mr. Soames: that, unless the Indian\n",
      "student recognized the roll as being proofs, the man who tam-\n",
      "pered with them came upon them accidentally without knowing\n",
      "that they were there.\"\n",
      "  \"So it seems to me.\"\n",
      "  Holmes gave an enigmatic smile.\n",
      "  \"Well,\" said he. \"let us go round. Not one of your cases.\n",
      "Watson -- mental, not physical. All right; come if you want to.\n",
      "Now, Mr. Soames -- at your disposal!\"\n",
      "  The sitting-room of our client opened by a long, low, latticed\n",
      "window on to the ancient lichen-tinted court of the old college.\n",
      "A Gothic arched door led to a worn stone staircase. On the\n",
      "ground floor was the tutor's room. Above were three students,\n",
      "one on each story. It was already twilight when we reached the\n",
      "scene of our problem. Holmes halted and looked earnestly at the\n",
      "window. Then he approached it, and, standing on tiptoe with his\n",
      "neck craned, he looked into the room.\n",
      "  \"He must have entered through the door. There is no opening\n",
      "except the one pane,\" said our learned guide.\n",
      "  \"Dear me!\" said Holmes, and he smiled in a singular way as\n",
      "he glanced at our companion. \"Well, if there is nothing to be\n",
      "learned here, we had best go inside.\"\n",
      "  The lecturer unlocked the outer door and ushered us into his\n",
      "room. We stood at the entrance while Holmes made an examina-\n",
      "tion of the carpet.\n",
      "  \"I am afraid there are no signs here,\" said he. \"One could\n",
      "hardly hope for any upon so dry a day. Your servant seems to\n",
      "have quite recovered. You left him in a chair, you say. Which\n",
      "chair?\"\n",
      "  \"By the window there.\"\n",
      "  \"I see. Near this little table. You can come in now. I have\n",
      "finished with the carpet. Let us take the little table first. Of\n",
      "course, what has happened is very clear. The man entered and\n",
      "took the papers, sheet by sheet, from the central table. He\n",
      "carried them over to the window table, because from there he\n",
      "could see if you came across the courtyard, and so could effect\n",
      "an escape.\"\n",
      "  \"As a matter of fact, he could not,\" said Soames, \"for I\n",
      "entered by the side door.\"\n",
      "  \"Ah, that's good! Well, anyhow, that was in his mind. Let\n",
      "me see the three strips. No finger impressions -- no! Well he\n",
      "carried over this one first, and he copied it. How long wouid it\n",
      "take him to do that, using every possible contraction? A quarter\n",
      "of an hour, not less. Then he tossed it down and seized the next.\n",
      "He was in the midst of that when your return caused him to make\n",
      "a very hurried retreat -- very hurried, since he had not time to\n",
      "replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there.\n",
      "You were not aware of any hurrying feet on the stair as you\n",
      "entered the outer door?\"\n",
      "  \"No, I can't say I was.\"\n",
      "  \"Well, he wrote so furiously that he broke his pencil, and\n",
      "had, as you observe, to sharpen it again. This is of interest,\n",
      "Watson. The pencil was not an ordinary one. It was above the\n",
      "usual size, with a soft lead, the outer colour was dark blue, the\n",
      "maker's name was printed in silver lettering, and the piece\n",
      "remaining is only about an inch and a half long. Look for such a\n",
      "pencil, Mr. Soames, and you have got your man. When I add\n",
      "that he possesses a large and very blunt knife, you have an\n",
      "additional aid.\"\n",
      "  Mr. Soames was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of\n",
      "information. \"I can follow the other points,\" said he, \"but\n",
      "really, in this matter of the length --\"\n",
      "  Holmes held out a small chip with the letters NN and a space\n",
      "of clear wood after them.\n",
      "  \"You see?\"\n",
      "  \"No, I fear that even now --\"\n",
      "  \"Watson, I have always done you an injustice. There are\n",
      "others. What could this NN be? It is at the end of a word. You\n",
      "are aware that Johann Faber is the most common maker's name.\n",
      "Is it not clear that there is just as much of the pencil left as\n",
      "usually follows the Johann?\" He held the small table sideways to\n",
      "the electric light. \"I was hoping that if the paper on which he\n",
      "wrote was thin, some trace of it might come through upon this\n",
      "polished surface. No, I see nothing. I don't think there is any-\n",
      "thing more to be learned here. Now for the central table. This\n",
      "small pellet is, I presume, the black, doughy mass you spoke of.\n",
      "Roughly pyramidal in shape and hollowed out, I perceive. As\n",
      "you say, there appear to be grains of sawdust in it. Dear me, this\n",
      "is very interesting. And the cut -- a positive tear, I see. It began\n",
      "with a thin scratch and ended in a jagged hole. I am much\n",
      "indebted to you for directing my attention to this case, Mr.\n",
      "Soames. Where does that door lead to?\"\n",
      "  \"To my bedroom.\"\n",
      "  \"Have you been in it since your adventure?\"\n",
      "  \"No, I came straight away for you.\"\n",
      "  \"I should like to have a glance round. What a charming,\n",
      "old-fashioned room! Perhaps you will kindly wait a minute, until\n",
      "I have examined the floor. No, I see nothing. What about this\n",
      "curtain? You hang your clothes behind it. If anyone were forced\n",
      "to conceal himself in this room he must do it there, since the bed\n",
      "is too low and the wardrobe too shallow. No one there, I\n",
      "suppose?\"\n",
      "  As Holmes drew the curtain I was aware, from some little\n",
      "rigidity and alertness of his attitude, that he was prepared for an\n",
      "emergency. As a matter of fact, the drawn curtain disclosed\n",
      "nothing but three or four suits of clothes hanging from a line of\n",
      "pegs. Holmes turned away, and stooped suddenly to the floor.\n",
      "  \"Halloa! What's this?\" said he.\n",
      "  It was a small pyramid of black, putty-like stuff, exactly like\n",
      "the one upon the table of the study. Holmes held it out on his\n",
      "open palm in the glare of the electric light.\n",
      "  \"Your visitor seems to have left traces in your bedroom as\n",
      "well as in your sitting-room, Mr. Soames.\"\n",
      "  \"What could he have wanted there?\"\n",
      "  \"I think it is clear enough. You came back by an unexpected\n",
      "way, and so he had no warning until you were at the very door.\n",
      "What could he do? He caught up everything which would betray\n",
      "him, and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself.\"\n",
      "  \"Good gracious, Mr. Holmes, do you mean to tell me that, all\n",
      "the time I was talking to Bannister in this room, we had the man\n",
      "prisoner if we had only known it?\"\n",
      "  \"So I read it.\"\n",
      "  \"Surely there is another alternative, Mr. Holmes. I don't\n",
      "know whether you observed my bedroom window?\"\n",
      "  \"Lattice-paned, lead framework, three separate windows, one\n",
      "swinging on hinge, and large enough to admit a man.\"\n",
      "  \"Exactly. And it looks out on an angle of the courtyard so as\n",
      "to be partly invisible. The man might have effected his entrance\n",
      "there, left traces as he passed through the bedroom, and finally,\n",
      "finding the door open, have escaped that way.\"\n",
      "  Holmes shook his head impatiently.\n",
      "  \"Let us be practical,\" said he. \"I understand you to say that\n",
      "there are three students who use this stair, and are in the habit of\n",
      "passing your door?\"\n",
      "  \"Yes, there are.\"\n",
      "  \"And they are all in for this examination?\"\n",
      "  \"Yes.\"\n",
      "  \"Have you any reason to suspect any one of them more than\n",
      "the others?\"\n",
      "  Soames hesitated.\n",
      "  \"It is a very delicate question.\" said he. \"One hardly likes to\n",
      "throw suspicion where there are no proofs.\"\n",
      "  \"Let us hear the suspicions. I will look after the proofs.\"\n",
      "  \"I will tell you, then, in a few words the character of the three\n",
      "mcn who inhabit these rooms. The lower of the three is Gilchrist,\n",
      "a fine scholar and athletc, plays in the Rugby team and the\n",
      "cricket team for the college, and got his Blue for the hurdles and\n",
      "the long jump. He is a fine, manly fellow. His father was the\n",
      "notorious Sir Jabez Gilchrist, who ruined himself on the turf. My\n",
      "scholar has been left very poor, but he is hard-working and\n",
      "industrious. He will do well.\n",
      "  \"The second floor is inhabited by Daulat Ras, the Indian. He\n",
      "is a quiet, inscrutable fellow; as most of those Indians are. He is\n",
      "well up in his work, though his Greek is his weak subject. He is\n",
      "steady and methodical.\n",
      "  \"The top floor belongs to Miles McLaren. He is a brilliant\n",
      "fellow when he chooses to work -- one of the brightest intellects\n",
      "of the university; but he is wayward, dissipated, and unprinci-\n",
      "pled. He was nearly expelled over a card scandal in his first\n",
      "year. He has been idling all this term, and he must look forward\n",
      "with dread to the examination.\"\n",
      "  \"Then it is he whom you suspect?\"\n",
      "  \"I dare not go so far as that. But, of the three, he is perhaps the\n",
      "least unlikely.\"\n",
      "  \"Exactly. Now, Mr. Soames, let us have a look at your\n",
      "servant, Bannister.\"\n",
      "  He was a little, white-faced, clean-shaven, grizzly-haired fel-\n",
      "low of fifty. He was still suffering from this sudden disturbance\n",
      "of the quiet routine of his life. His plump face was twitching\n",
      "with his nervousness, and his fingers could not keep still.\n",
      "  \"We are investigating this unhappy business, Bannister,\" said\n",
      "his master.\n",
      "  \"Yes, sir.\"\n",
      "  \"I understand,\" said Holmes, \"that you left your key in the\n",
      "door?\"\n",
      "  \"Yes, sir.\"\n",
      "  \"Was it not very extraordinary that you should do this on the\n",
      "very day when there were these papers inside?\"\n",
      "  \"It was most unfortunate. sir. But I have occasionally done\n",
      "the same thing at other times.\"\n",
      "  \"When did you enter the room?\"\n",
      "  It was about half-past four. That is Mr. Soames's tea time.\"\n",
      "  \"How long did you stay?\"\n",
      "  \"When I saw that he was absent. I withdrew at once.\"\n",
      "  \"Did you look at these papers on the table?\"\n",
      "  \"No, sir certainly not.\"\n",
      "  \"How came you to leave the key in the door?\"\n",
      "  \"I had the tea-tray in my hand. I thought I would come back\n",
      "for the key. Then I forgot.\"\n",
      "  \"Has the outer door a spring lock?\"\n",
      "  \"No, sir.\"\n",
      "  \"Then it was open all the time?\"\n",
      "  \"Yes, sir.\"\n",
      "  \"Anyone in the room could get out?\"\n",
      "  \"Yes, sir.\"\n",
      "  \"When Mr. Soames returned and called for you, you were\n",
      "very much disturbed?\"\n",
      "  \"Yes, sir. Such a thing has never happened during the many\n",
      "years that I have been here. I nearly fainted, sir.\"\n",
      "  \"So I understand. Where were you when you began to feel\n",
      "bad?\"\n",
      "  \"Where was I, sir? Why, here, near the door.\"\n",
      "  \"That is singular, because you sat down in that chair over\n",
      "yonder near the corner. Why did you pass these other chairs?\"\n",
      "  \"I don't know, sir, it didn't matter to me where I sat.\"\n",
      "  \"I really don't think he knew much about it, Mr. Holmes. He\n",
      "was looking very bad -- quite ghastly.\"\n",
      "  \"You stayed here when your master left?\"\n",
      "  \"Only for a minute or so. Then I locked the door and went to\n",
      "my room.\"\n",
      "  \"Whom do you suspect?\"\n",
      "  \"Oh, I would not venture to say, sir. I don't believe there is\n",
      "any gentleman in this university who is capable of profiting by\n",
      "such an action. No, sir, I'll not believe it.\"\n",
      "  \"Thank you, that will do,\" said Holmes. \"Oh, one more\n",
      "word. You have not mentioned to any of the three gentlemen\n",
      "whom you attend that anything is amiss?\"\n",
      "  \"No, sir -- not a word.\"\n",
      "  \"You haven't seen any of them?\"\n",
      "  \"No, sir.\"\n",
      "  \"Very good. Now, Mr. Soames, we will take a walk in the\n",
      "quadrangle, if you please.\"\n",
      "  Three yellow squares of light shone above us in the gathering\n",
      "gloom.\n",
      "  \"Your three birds are all in their nests,\" said Holmes, looking\n",
      "up. \"Halloa! What's that? One of them seems restless enough.\"\n",
      "  It was the Indian, whose dark silhouette appeared suddenly\n",
      "upon his blind. He was pacing swiftly up and down his room.\n",
      "  \"I should like to have a peep at each of them,\" said Holmes.\n",
      "\"Is it possible?\"\n",
      "  \"No difficulty in the world,\" Soames answered. \"This set of\n",
      "rooms is quite the oldest in the college, and it is not unusual for\n",
      "visitors to go over them. Come along, and I will personally\n",
      "conduct you.\"\n",
      "  \"No names, please!\" said Holmes, as we knocked at Gilchrist's\n",
      "door. A tall, flaxen-haired, slim young fellow opened it, and\n",
      "made us welcome when he understood our errand. There were\n",
      "some really curious pieces of mediaeval domestic architecture\n",
      "within. Holmes was so charmed with one of them that he insisted\n",
      "on drawing it in his notebook, broke his pencil, had to borrow\n",
      "one from our host, and finally borrowed a knife to sharpen his\n",
      "own. The same curious accident happened to him in the rooms of\n",
      "the Indian -- a silent, little, hook-nosed fellow, who eyed us\n",
      "askance, and was obviously glad when Holmes's architectural\n",
      "studies had come to an end. I could not see that in either case\n",
      "Holmes had come upon the clue for which he was searching.\n",
      "Only at the third did our visit prove abortive. The outer door\n",
      "would not open to our knock, and-nothing more substantial than\n",
      "a torrent of bad language came from behind it. \"I don't care who\n",
      "you are. You can go to blazes!\" roared the angry voice. \"To-\n",
      "morrow's the exam, and I won't be drawn by anyone.\"\n",
      "  \"A rude fellow,\" said our guide, flushing with anger as we\n",
      "withdrew down the stair. \"Of course, he did not realize that it\n",
      "was I who was knocking, but none the less his conduct was very\n",
      "uncourteous, and, indeed, under the circumstances rather\n",
      "suspicious.\"\n",
      "  Holmes's response was a curious one.\n",
      "  \"Can you tell me his exact height?\" he asked.\n",
      "  \"Really, Mr. Holmes, I cannot undertake to say. He is taller\n",
      "than the Indian, not so tall as Gilchrist. I suppose five foot six\n",
      "would be about it.\"\n",
      "  \"That is very important,\" said Holmes. \"And now, Mr.\n",
      "Soames, I wish you good-night.\"\n",
      "  Our guide cried aloud in his astonishment and dismay. \"Good\n",
      "gracious, Mr. Holmes, you are surely not going to leave me in\n",
      "this abrupt fashion! You don't seem to realize the position.\n",
      "To-morrow is the examination. I must take some definite action\n",
      "to-night. I cannot allow the examination to be held if one of the\n",
      "papers has been tampered with. The situation must be faced.\"\n",
      "  \"You must leave it as it is. I shall drop round early to-morrow\n",
      "morning and chat the matter over. It is possible that I may be in\n",
      "a position then to indicate some course of action. Meanwhile,\n",
      "you change nothing -- nothing at all.\"\n",
      "  \"Very good, Mr. Holmes.\"\n",
      "  \"You can be perfectly easy in your mind. We shall certainly\n",
      "find some way out of your difficulties. I will take the black clay\n",
      "with me, also the pencil cuttings. Good-bye.\"\n",
      "  When we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle, we again\n",
      "looked up at the windows. The Indian still paced his room. The\n",
      "others were invisible.\n",
      "  \"Well, Watson, what do you think of it?\" Holmes asked, as\n",
      "we came out into the main street. \"Quite a little parlour game -- \n",
      "sort of three-card trick, is it not? There are your three men. It\n",
      "must be one of them. You take your choice. Which is yours?\"\n",
      "  \"The foul-mouthed fellow at the top. He is the one with the\n",

      "moment was of value. No, I see nothing in that. Pencils, too,\n",

      "  \"Who?\"\n",

      "perfectly honest man -- Well, well, here's a large stationer's. We\n",
      "shall begin our researches here.\"\n",
      "  There were only four stationers of any consequences in the\n",
      "town, and at each Holmes produced his pencil chips, and bid\n",
      "high for a duplicate. All were agreed that one could be ordered,\n",
      "but that it was not a usual size of pencil, and that it was seldom\n",
      "kept in stock. My friend did not appear to be depressed by his\n",
      "failure, but shrugged his shoulders in half-humorous resignation.\n",
      "  \"No good, my dear Watson. This, the best and only final\n",
      "clue, has run to nothing. But, indeed, I have little doubt that we\n",
      "can build up a sufficient case without it. By Jove! my dear\n",
      "fellow, it is nearly nine, and the landlady babbled of green peas\n",
      "at seven-thirty. What with your eternal tobacco, Watson, and\n",
      "your irregularity at meals, I expect that you will get notice to\n",
      "quit, and that I shall share your downfall -- not, however, before\n",
      "we have solved the problem of the nervous tutor, the careless\n",
      "servant, and the three enterprising students.\"\n",
      "  Holmes made no further allusion to the matter that day, though\n",
      "he sat lost in thought for a long time after our belated dinner. At\n",
      "eight in the morning, he came into my room just as I finished my\n",
      "toilet.\n",
      "  \"Well, Watson,\" said he, \"it is time we went down to St.\n",

      "  \"But what fresh evidence could you have got?\"\n",

      "work and covered at least five miles, with something to show for\n",
      "it. Look at that!\"\n",
      "  He held out his hand. On the palm were three little pyramids\n",

      "between making the facts public and allowing the culprit to\n",
      "compete for the valuable scholarship. He could hardly stand still,\n",
      "so great was his mental agitation, and he ran towards Holmes\n",
      "with two eager hands outstretched.\n",
      "  \"Thank heaven that you have come! I feared that you had\n",

      "proceed?\"\n",
      "  \"Yes, let it proceed, by all means.\"\n",
      "  \"But this rascal?\"\n",
      "  \"He shall not compete.\"\n",
      "  \"You know him?\"\n",
      "  \"I think so. If this matter is not to become public. we must\n",
      "give ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small\n",
      "private court-martial. You there, if you please, Soames! Watson\n",
      "you here! I'll take the armchair in the middle. I think that we are\n",
      "now sufficiently imposing to strike terror into a guilty breast.\n",
      "Kindly ring the bell!\"\n",
      "  Bannister entered, and shrank back in evident surprise and fear\n",
      "at our judicial appearance.\n",
      "  \"You will kindly close the door,\" said Holmes. \"Now\n",
      "Bannister, will you please tell us the truth about yesterday's\n",
      "incident.'\n",
      "  The man turned white to the roots of his hair.\n",
      "  \"I have told you everything, sir.\"\n",
      "  \"Nothing to add?\"\n",
      "  \"Nothing at all, sir.\"\n",
      "  \"Well, then, I must make some suggestions to you. When you\n",
      "sat down on that chair yesterday, did you do so in order to\n",
      "conceal some object which would have shown who had been in\n",
      "the room?\"\n",
      "  Bannister's face was ghastly.\n",
      "  \"No, sir, certainly not.\"\n",
      "  \"It is only a suggestion,\" said Holmes, suavely. \"I frankly\n",
      "admit that I am unable to prove it. But it seems probable enough\n",
      "since the moment that Mr. Soames's back was turned, you\n",
      "released the man who was hiding in that bedroom.\"\n",
      "  Bannister licked his dry lips.\n",
      "  \"There was no man, sir.\"\n",
      "  \"Ah, that's a pity, Bannister. Up to now you may have\n",
      "spoken the truth, but now I know that you have lied.\"\n",
      "  The man's face set in sullen defiance.\n",
      "  \"There was no man, sir.\"\n",
      "  \"Come, come, Bannister!\"\n",
      "  \"No, sir, there was no one.\"\n",
      "  \"In that case, you can give us no further information. Would\n",
      "you please remain in the room? Stand over there near the bed-\n",
      "room door. Now, Soames, I am going to ask you to have the\n",
      "great kindness to go up to the room of young Gilchrist. and to\n",
      "ask him to step down into yours.\"\n",
      "  An instant later the tutor returned, bringing with him the\n",
      "student. He was a fine figure of a man, tall, lithe, and agile, with\n",
      "a springy step and a pleasant, open face. His troubled blue eyes\n",
      "glanced at each of us, and finally rested with an expression of\n",
      "blank dismay upon Bannister in the farther corner.\n",
      "  \"Just close the door,\" said Holmes. \"Now, Mr. Gilchrist, we\n",
      "are all quite alone here, and no one need ever know one word of\n",
      "what passes between us. We can be perfectly frank with each\n",
      "other. We want to know, Mr. Gilchrist, how you, an honourable\n",
      "man, ever came to commit such an action as that of yesterday?\"\n",
      "  The unfortunate young man staggered back, and cast a look\n",
      "full of horror and reproach at Bannister.\n",
      "  \"No, no, Mr. Gilchrist, sir, I never said a word -- never one\n",
      "word!\" cried the servant.\n",
      "  \"No, but you have now,\" said Holmes. \"Now, sir, you must\n",
      "see that after Bannister's words your position is hopeless, and\n",
      "that your only chance lies in a frank confession.\"\n",
      "  For a moment Gilchrist, with upraised hand, tried to control\n",
      "his writhing features. The next he had thrown himself on his\n",
      "knees beside the table, and burying his face in his hands, he had\n",
      "burst into a storm of passionate sobbing.\n",
      "  \"Come, come,\" said Holmes, kindly, \"it is human to err,\n",
      "and at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal.\n",
      "Perhaps it would be easier for you if I were to tell Mr. Soames\n",
      "what occurred, and you can check me where I am wrong. Shall I\n",
      "do so? Well, well, don't trouble to answer. Listen, and see that I\n",
      "do you no injustice.\n",
      "  \"From the moment, Mr. Soames, that you said to me that no\n",
      "one, not even Bannister, could have told that the papers were in\n",
      "your room, the case began to take a definite shape in my mind.\n",
      "The printer one could, of course, dismiss. He could examine the\n",
      "papers in his own office. The Indian I also thought nothing of. If\n",
      "the proofs were in a roll, he could not possibly know what they\n",
      "were. On the other hand, it seemed an unthinkable coincidence\n",
      "that a man should dare to enter the room, and that by chance on\n",
      "that very day the papers were on the table. I dismissed that. The\n",
      "man who entered knew that the papers were there. How did he\n",
      "know?\n",
      "  \"When I approached your room, I examined the window. You\n",
      "amused me by supposing that I was contemplating the possibility\n",
      "of someone having in broad daylight, under the eyes of all these\n",
      "opposite rooms, forced himself through it. Such an idea was\n",
      "absurd. I was measuring how tall a man would need to be in\n",
      "order to see, as he passed, what papers were on the central table.\n",
      "I am six feet high, and I could do it with an effort. No one less\n",
      "than that would have a chance. Already you see I had reason to\n",
      "think that, if one of your three students was a man of unusual\n",
      "height, he was the most worth watching of the three.\n",
      "  \"I entered, and I took you into my confidencc as to the\n",
      "suggestions of the side table. Of the centre table I could make\n",
      "nothing, until in your description of Gilchrist you mentioned that\n",
      "he was a long-distance jumper. Then the whole thing came to me\n",
      "in an instant, and I only needed certain corroborative proofs,\n",
      "which I speedily obtained.\n",
      "  \"What happened was this: This young fellow had employed\n",
      "his afternoon at the athletic grounds, where he had been practis-\n",
      "ing the jump. He returned carrying his jumping-shoes, which are\n",
      "provided, as you are aware, with several sharp spikes. As he\n",
      "passed your window he saw, by means of his great height, these\n",
      "proofs upon your table, and conjectured what they were. No\n",
      "harm would have been done had it not been that, as he passed\n",
      "your door, he perceived the key which had been left by the\n",
      "carelessness of your servant. A sudden impulse came over him to\n",
      "enter, and see if they were indeed the proofs. It was not a\n",
      "dangerous exploit, for he could always pretend that he had simply\n",
      "looked in to ask a question.\n",
      "  \"Well, when he saw that they were indeed the proofs, it was\n",
      "then that he yielded to temptation. He put his shoes on the table.\n",
      "What was it you put on that chair near the window?\"\n",
      "  \"Gloves,\" said the young man.\n",
      "  Holmes looked triumphantly at Bannister. \"He put his gloves\n",
      "on the chair, and he took the proofs, sheet by sheet, to copy\n",
      "them. He thought the tutor must return by the main gate, and that\n",
      "he would see him. As we know, he came back by the side gate.\n",
      "Suddenly he heard him at the very door. There was no possible\n",
      "escape. He forgot his gloves, but he caught up his shoes and\n",
      "darted into the bedroom. You observe that the scratch on that\n",
      "table is slight at one side, but deepens in the direction of the\n",
      "bedroom door. That in itself is enough to show us that the shoe\n",
      "had been drawn in that direction, and that the culprit had taken\n",
      "refuge there. The earth round the spike had been left on the\n",
      "table, and a second sample was loosened and fell in the bed-\n",
      "room. I may add that I walked out to the athletic grounds this\n",
      "morning, saw that tenacious black clay is used in the jumping-\n",
      "pit, and carried away a specimen of it, together with some of the\n",
      "fine tan or sawdust which is strewn over it to prevent the athlete\n",
      "from slipping. Have I told the truth, Mr. Gilchrist?\"\n",
      "  The student had drawn himself erect.\n",
      "  \"Yes, sir, it is true,\" said he.\n",
      "  \"Good heavens! have you nothing to add?\" cried Soames.\n",
      "  \"Yes, sir, I have, but the shock of this disgraceful exposure\n",
      "has bewildered me. I have a letter here, Mr. Soames, which I\n",
      "wrote to you early this morning in the middle of a restless night.\n",
      "It was before I knew that my sin had found me out. Here it is,\n",
      "sir. You will see that I have said, 'I have determined not to go\n",
      "in for the examination. I have been offered a commission in\n",
      "the Rhodesian Police, and I am going out to South Africa at\n",
      "once.' \"\n",
      "  \"I am indeed pleased to hear that you did not intend to profit\n",
      "by your unfair advantage,\" said Soames. \"But why did you\n",
      "change your purpose?\"\n",
      "  Gilchrist pointed to Bannister.\n",
      "  \"There is the man who set me in the right path,\" said he.\n",
      "  \"Come now, Bannister,\" said Holmes. \"It will be clear to\n",
      "you, from what I have said, that only you could have let this\n",
      "young man out, since you were left in the room, and must have\n",
      "locked the door when you went out. As to his escaping by that\n",
      "window, it was incredible. Can you not clear up the last point in\n",
      "this mystery, and tell us the reasons for your action?\"\n",
      "  \"It was simple enough, sir, if you only had known, but, with\n",
      "all your cleverness, it was impossible that you could know. Time\n",
      "was, sir, when I was butler to old Sir Jabez Gilchrist, this young\n",
      "gentleman's father. When he was ruined I came to the college as\n",
      "servant, but I never forgot my old employer because he was\n",
      "down in the world. I watched his son all I could for the sake of\n",
      "the old days. Well, sir, when I came into this room yesterday,\n",
      "when the alarm was given, the very first thing I saw was Mr.\n",
      "Gilchrist's tan gloves a-lying in that chair. I knew those gloves\n",
      "well, and I understood their message. If Mr. Soames saw them,\n",
      "the game was up. I flopped down into that chair, and nothing\n",
      "would budge me until Mr. Soames went for you. Then out came\n",
      "my poor young master, whom I had dandled on my knee, and\n",
      "confessed it all to me. Wasn't it natural, sir, that I should save\n",
      "him, and wasn't it natural also that I should try to speak to him\n",
      "as his dead father would have done, and make him understand\n",
      "that he could not profit by such a deed? Could you blame me,\n",
      "sir?\"\n",
      "  \"No, indeed,\" said Holmes, heartily, springing to his feet.\n",

      "\n",
      "   Once upon a time . . . a woodcutter lived happily with his wife in a pretty\n",
      "little log cabin in the middle of a thick forest. Each morning he set off \n",
      "singing to work, and when he came home in the evening, a plate of hot steaming \n",
      "soup was always waiting for him. \n",
      "   One day, however, he had a strange surprise. He came upon a big fir tree \n",
      "with strange open holes on the trunk. It looked somehow different from the \n",
      "other trees, and just as he was about to chop it down, the alarmed face of an \n",
      "elf popped out of a hole.\n",
      "   \"What's all this banging?\" asked the elf. \"You're not thinking of cutting \n",
      "down this tree, are you? It's my home. I live here!\" The woodcutter dropped \n",
      "his axe in astonlshment.\n",
      "   \"Well, I . . .\" he stammered.\n",
      "   \"With all the other trees there are in this forest, you have to pick this \n",
      "one. Lucky I was in, or I would have found myself homeless.\"\n",
      "   Taken aback at these words, the woodcutter qulckly recovered, for after all\n",
      "the elf was quite tiny, while he himself was a big hefty chap, and he boldly \n",
      "replied: \"I'll cut down any tree I like, so . . .\" \n",
      "   \"All right! All right!\" broke in the elf. \"Shall we put it this way: if you\n",
      "don't cut down this tree, I grant you three wishes. Agreed?\" The woodcutter \n",
      "scratched his head. \n",
      "   \"Three wishes, you say? Yes, I agree.\" And he began to hack at another \n",
      "tree. As he worked and sweated at his task, the woodcutter kept thinking about\n",
      "the magic wishes. \n",
      "   \"I'll see what my wife thinks...\"\n",
      "   The woodcutter's wife was busily cleaning a pot outside the house when her \n",
      "husband arrived. Grabbing her round the waist, he twirled her in delight.\n",
      "   \"Hooray! Hooray! Our luck is in!\" \n",
      "   The woman could not understand why her husband was so pleased with himself \n",
      "and she shrugged herself free. Later, however, over a glass of fine wine at \n",
      "the table, the woodcutter told his wife of his meeting with the elf, and she \n",
      "too began to picture the wonderful things that the elf's three wishes might \n",
      "give them. The woodcutter's wife took a first sip of wine from her husband's \n",
      "glass.\n",
      "   \"Nice,\" she said, smacking her lips. \"I wish I had a string of sausages to \n",
      "go with it, though...\"\n",
      "   Instantly she bit her tongue, but too late. Out of the air appeared the \n",
      "sausages while the woodcutter stuttered with rage.\n",
      "   \". . . what have you done! Sausages . . . What a stupid waste of a wish! \n",
      "You foollsh woman. I wish they would stick up your nose!\" No sooner sald than\n",
      "done. For the sausages leapt up and stuck fast to the end of the woman's nose.\n",
      "This time, the woodcutter's wife flew into a rage.\n",
      "   \"You idiot, what have you done? With all the things we could have wished \n",
      "for . . .\" The mortified woodcutter, who had just repeated his wife's own \n",
      "mistake, exclaimed:\n",
      "   \"I'd chop . . .\" Luckily he stopped himself in time, realizing with horror \n",
      "that he'd been on the point of having his tongue chopped off. As his wife \n",
      "complained and blamed him, the poor man burst out laughing.\n",
      "   \"If only you knew how funny you look with those sausages on the end of your\n",
      "nose!\" Now that really upset the woodcutter's wife. She hadn't thought of her \n",
      "looks. She tried to tug away the sausages but they would not budge. She pulled \n",
      "again and again, but in vain. The sausages were firmly attached to her nose. \n",
      "Terrified, she exclaimed: \"They'll be there for the rest of my life!\"\n",
      "   Feeling sorry for his wife and wondering how he could ever put up with a \n",
      "woman with such an awkward nose, the woodcutter said: \"I'll try.\" Grasping the\n",
      "string of sausages, he tugged with all his might. But he simply pulled his \n",
      "wife over on top of him. The pair sat on the floor, gazing sadly at each other.\n",
      "   \"What shall we do now?\" they said, each thinking the same thought.\n",
      "   \"There's only one thing we can do . . .\" ventured the woodcutter's wife \n",
      "timidly.\n",
      "   \"Yes, I'm afraid so . . .\" her husband sighed, remembering their dreams of \n",
      "riches, and he bravely wished the third and last wish \"I wish the sausages \n",
      "would leave my wife's nose.\"\n",
      "   And they did. Instantly, husband and wife hugged each other tearfully, \n",
      "saying \"Maybe we'll be poor, but we'll be happy again!\"\n",
      "   That evening, the only reminder of the woodcutter's meeting with the elf \n",

      "more likely to be some crony of the landlady's.\"\n",
      "  Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for\n",
      "there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He\n",
      "stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself\n",
      "and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.\n",
      "  \"Come in!\" said he.\n",
      "  The man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the\n",
      "outside, well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refine-\n",
      "ment and delicacy in his bearing. The streaming umbrella which\n",
      "he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told of the\n",
      "fierce weather through which he had come. He looked about him\n",
      "anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his face\n",
      "was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is weighed\n",
      "down with some great anxiety.\n",
      "  \"l owe you an apology,\" he said, raising his golden pince-nez\n",
      "to his eyes. \"I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have\n",
      "brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber.\"\n",
      "  \"Give me your coat and umbrella,\" said Holmes. \"They may\n",
      "rest here on the hook and will be dry presently. You have come\n",
      "up from the south-west, I see.\"\n",
      "  \"Yes, from Horsham.\"\n",
      "  \"That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps\n",
      "is quite distinctive.\"\n",
      "  \"I have come for advice.\"\n",
      "  \"That is easily got.\"\n",
      "  \"And help.\"\n",
      "  \"That is not always so easy.\"\n",
      "  \"I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major\n",
      "Prendergast how you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal.\"\n",
      "  \"Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at\n",
      "cards.\"\n",
      "  \"He said that you could solve anything.\"\n",
      "  \"He said too much.\"\n",
      "  \"That you are never beaten.\"\n",
      "  \"I have been beaten four times  -  three times by men, and\n",
      "once by a woman.\"\n",
      "  \"But what is that compared with the number of your successes?\"\n",
      "  \"It is true that I have been generally successful.\"\n",
      "  \"Then you may be so with me.\"\n",
      "  \"I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour\n",
      "me with some details as to your case.\"\n",
      "  \"It is no ordinary one.\"\n",
      "  \"None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of\n",
      "appeal.\"\n",
      "  \"And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you\n",
      "have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of\n",
      "events than those which have happened in my own family.\"\n",
      "  \"You fill me with interest,\" said Holmes. \"Pray give us the\n",
      "essential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards\n",
      "question you as to those details which seem to me to be most\n",
      "important.\"\n",
      "  The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out\n",
      "towards the blaze.\n",
      "  \"My name,\" said he, \"is John Openshaw, but my own affairs\n",
      "have, as far as I can understand, little to do with this awful\n",
      "business. It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea\n",
      "of the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the affair.\n",
      "  \"You must know that my grandfather had two sons -- my\n",
      "uncle Elias and my father Joseph. My father had a small factory\n",
      "at Coventry, which he enlarged at the time of the invention of\n",
      "bicycling. He was a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire,\n",
      "and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it\n",
      "and to retire upon a handsome competence.\n",
      "  \"My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young\n",
      "man and became a planter in Florida, where he was reported to\n",
      "have done very well. At the time of the war he fought in\n",
      "Jackson's army, and afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be\n",
      "a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his\n",
      "plantation, where he remained for three or four years. About\n",
      "1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe and took a small estate in\n",
      "Sussex, near Horsham. He had made a very considerable fortune\n",
      "in the States, and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to\n",
      "the negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in extend-\n",
      "ing the franchise to them. He was a singular man, fierce and\n",
      "quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a\n",
      "most retiring disposition. During all the years that he lived at\n",
      "Horsham, I doubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a\n",
      "garden and two or three fields round his house, and there he\n",
      "would take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end he\n",
      "would never leave his room. He drank a great deal of brandy and\n",
      "smoked very heavily, but he would see no society and did not\n",
      "want any friends, not even his own brother.\n",
      "  \"He didn't mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the\n",
      "time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so.\n",
      "This would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine\n",
      "years in England. He begged my father to let me live with him\n",
      "and he was very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he\n",
      "used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me,\n",
      "and he would make me his representative both with the servants\n",
      "and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I\n",
      "was quite master of the house. I kept all the keys and could go\n",
      "where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb\n",
      "him in his privacy. There was one singular exception, however,\n",
      "for he had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics,\n",
      "which was invariably locked, and which he would never permit\n",
      "either me or anyone else to enter. With a boy's curiosity I have\n",
      "peeped through the keyhole, but I was never able to see more\n",
      "than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be\n",
      "expected in such a room.\n",
      "  \"One day -- it was in March, 1883 -- a letter with a foreign\n",
      "stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonel's plate. It was\n",
      "not a common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were\n",
      "all paid in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. 'From\n",
      "India!' said he as he took it up, 'Pondicherry postmark! What\n",
      "can this be?' Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little\n",
      "dried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began\n",
      "to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the\n",
      "sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his\n",
      "skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he\n",
      "still held in his trembling hand, 'K. K. K.!' he shrieked, and\n",
      "then, 'My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!'\n",
      "  \" 'What is it, uncle?' I cried.\n",
      "  \" 'Death,' said he, and rising from the table he retired to his\n",
      "room, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope\n",
      "and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the\n",
      "gum, the letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else\n",
      "save the five dried pips. What could be the reason of his over-\n",
      "powering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I ascended the\n",
      "stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key, which must\n",
      "have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small brass box,\n",
      "like a cashbox, in the other.\n",
      "  \" 'They may do what they like, but I'll checkmate them still,'\n",
      "said he with an oath. 'Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my\n",
      "room to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.'\n",
      "  \"I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked\n",
      "to step up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the\n",
      "grate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper,\n",
      "while the brass box stood open and empty beside it. As I glanced\n",
      "at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was printed\n",
      "the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the envelope.\n",
      "  \" 'I wish you, John,' said my uncle, 'to witness my will. I\n",
      "leave my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages,\n",
      "to my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to\n",
      "you. If you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you\n",
      "cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest\n",
      "enemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I\n",
      "can't say what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign the\n",
      "paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.'\n",
      "  \"I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away\n",
      "with him. The singular incident made, as you may think, the\n",
      "deepest impression upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it\n",
      "every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it.\n",
      "Yet I could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left\n",
      "behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed\n",
      "and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I\n",
      "could see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than\n",
      "ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of society. Most of his\n",
      "time he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the\n",
      "inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken\n",
      "frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the\n",
      "garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was\n",
      "afraid of no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a\n",
      "sheep in a pen, by man or devil. When these hot fits were over\n",
      "however, he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and\n",
      "bar it behind him, like a man who can brazen it out no longer\n",
      "against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul. At such\n",
      "times I have seen his face, even on a cold day, glisten with\n",
      "moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.\n",
      "  \"Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not\n",
      "to abuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of\n",
      "those drunken sallies from which he never came back. We found\n",
      "him, when we went to search for him, face downward in a little\n",
      "green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. There\n",
      "was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet\n",
      "deep, so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity,\n",
      "brought in a verdict of 'suicide.' But I, who knew how he\n",
      "winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade\n",
      "myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter\n",
      "passed, however, and my father entered into possession of the\n",
      "estate, and of some 14,000 pounds, which lay to his credit at the\n",
      "bank.\"\n",
      "  \"One moment,\" Holmes interposed, \"your statement is, I\n",
      "foresee, one of the most remarkable to which I have ever lis-\n",
      "tened. Let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the\n",
      "letter, and the date of his supposed suicide.\"\n",
      "  \"The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven\n",
      "weeks later, upon the night of May 2d.\"\n",
      "  \"Thank you. Pray proceed.\"\n",
      "  \"When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my\n",
      "request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been\n",
      "always locked up. We found the brass box there, although its\n",
      "contents had been destroyed. On the inside of the cover was a\n",
      "paper label, with the initials of K. K. K. repeated upon it, and\n",
      "'Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register' written beneath.\n",
      "These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had\n",
      "been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was\n",
      "nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many\n",
      "scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle's life in\n",
      "America. Some of them were of the war time and showed that he\n",
      "had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave\n",
      "soldier. Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the\n",
      "Southern states, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he\n",
      "had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag\n",
      "politicians who had been sent down from the North.\n",
      "  \"Well, it was the beginning of '84 when my father came to\n",
      "live at Horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until\n",
      "the January of '85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard\n",
      "my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the\n",
      "breakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly opened enve-\n",
      "lope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched\n",
      "palm of the other one. He had always laughed at what he called\n",
      "my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked very\n",
      "scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon\n",
      "himself.\n",
      "  \" 'Why, what on earth does this mean, John?' he stammered.\n",
      "  \"My heart had turned to lead. 'It is K. K. K.,' said I.\n",
      "  \"He looked inside the envelope. 'So it is,' he cried. 'Here are\n",
      "the very letters. But what is this written above them?'\n",
      "  \" 'Put the papers on the sundial,' I read, peeping over his\n",
      "shoulder.\n",
      "  \" 'What papers? What sundial?' he asked.\n",
      "  \" 'The sundial in the garden. There is no other,' said I; 'but\n",
      "the papers must be those that are destroyed.'\n",
      "  \" 'Pooh!' said he, gripping hard at his courage. 'We are in a\n",
      "civilized land here, and we can't have tomfoolery of this kind.\n",
      "Where does the thing come from?'\n",
      "  \" 'From Dundee,' I answered, glancing at the postmark.\n",
      "  \" 'Some preposterous practical joke,' said he. 'What have I to\n",
      "do with sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such\n",
      "nonsense.'\n",
      "  \" 'I should certainly speak to the police,' I said.\n",
      "  \" 'And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.'\n",
      "  \" 'Then let me do so?'\n",
      "  \" 'No, I forbid you. I won't have a fuss made about such\n",
      "nonsense.'\n",
      "  \"It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate\n",
      "man. I went about, however, with a heart which was full of\n",
      "forebodings.\n",
      "  \"On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went\n",
      "from home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is\n",
      "in command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad\n",
      "that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from\n",
      "danger when he was away from home. In that, however, I was in\n",
      "error. Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram\n",
      "from the major, imploring me to come at once. My father had\n",
      "fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the\n",
      "neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I\n",
      "hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recov-\n",
      "ered his consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning\n",
      "from Fareham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown\n",
      "to him, and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in\n",
      "bringing in a verdict of 'death from accidental causes.' Carefully\n",
      "as I examined every fact connected with his death, I was unable\n",
      "to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder. There\n",
      "were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no robbery, no record\n",
      "of strangers having been seen upon the roads. And yet I need not\n",
      "tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I was\n",
      "well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.\n",
      "  \"In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask\n",
      "me why I did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well\n",
      "convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an\n",
      "incident in my uncle's life, and that the danger would be as\n",
      "pressing in one house as in another.\n",
      "  \"It was in January, '85, that my poor father met his end, and\n",
      "two years and eight months have elapsed since then. During that\n",
      "time I have lived happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope\n",
      "that this curse had passed way from the family, and that it had\n",
      "ended with the last generation. I had begun to take comfort too\n",
      "soon, however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very\n",
      "shape in which it had come upon my father.\"\n",
      "  The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope,\n",
      "and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried\n",
      "orange pips.\n",
      "  \"This is the envelope,\" he continued. \"The postmark is\n",
      "London -- eastern division. Within are the very words which\n",
      "were upon my father's last message: 'K. K. K.'; and then 'Put\n",
      "the papers on the sundial.' \"\n",
      "  \"What have you done?'' asked Holmes.\n",
      "  \"Nothing.\"\n",
      "  \"Nothing?\"\n",
      "  \"To tell the truth\" -- he sank his face into his thin, white\n",
      "hands -- \"I have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor\n",
      "rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the\n",
      "grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and\n",
      "no precautions can guard against.\"\n",
      "  \"Tut! tut!\" cried Sherlock Holmes. \"You must act, man, or\n",
      "you are lost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time\n",
      "for despair.\"\n",
      "  \"I have seen the police.\"\n",
      "  \"Ah!\"\n",
      "  \"But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced\n",
      "that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all\n",
      "practical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really\n",
      "accidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with\n",
      "the warnings.\"\n",
      "  Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air. \"Incredible\n",
      "imbecility!\" he cried.\n",
      "  \"They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may re-\n",
      "main in the house with me.\"\n",
      "  \"Has he come with you to-night?\"\n",
      "  \"No. His orders were to stay in the house.\"\n",
      "  Again Holmes raved in the air.\n",
      "  \"Why did you come to me,\" he cried, \"and, above all, why\n",
      "did you not come at once?\"\n",
      "  \"I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major\n",
      "Prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come\n",
      "to you.\"\n",
      "  \"It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have\n",
      "acted before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than\n",
      "that which you have placed before us -- no suggestive detail\n",
      "which might help us?\"\n",
      "  \"There is one thing,\" said John Openshaw. He rummaged in\n",
      "his coat pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-\n",
      "tinted paper, he laid it out upon the table. \"I have some remem-\n",
      "brance,\" said he, \"that on the day when my uncle burned the\n",
      "papers I observed that the small, unburned margins which lay\n",
      "amid the ashes were of this particular colour. I found this single\n",
      "sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that\n",
      "it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out\n",
      "from among the others, and in that way has escaped destruction.\n",
      "Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I\n",
      "think myself that it is a page from some private diary. The\n",
      "writing is undoubtedly my uncle's.\"\n",
      "  Holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of\n",
      "paper, which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been\n",
      "torn from a book. It was headed, \"March, 1869,\" and beneath\n",
      "were the following enigmatical notices:\n",
      "\n",
      "     4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "     7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and John Swain,\n",
      "          of St. Augustine.\n",
      "     9th. McCauley cleared.\n",
      "     1Oth. John Swain cleared.\n",
      "     12th. Visited Paramore. All well.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"Thank you!\" said Holmes, folding up the paper and return-\n",
      "ing it to our visitor. \"And now you must on no account lose\n",
      "another instant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you\n",
      "have told me. You must get home instantly and act.\"\n",
      "  \"What shall I do?\"\n",
      "  \"There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You\n",
      "must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the\n",
      "brass box which you have described. You must also put in a note\n",
      "to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and\n",

      "  Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon\n",
      "the arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. \"The ideal\n",
      "reasoner,\" he remarked, \"would, when he had once been shown\n",
      "a single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the\n",
      "chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which\n",
      "would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a\n",
      "whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the\n",
      "observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of\n",
      "incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones,\n",
      "both before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which\n",
      "the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the\n",
      "study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by\n",
      "the aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest\n",
      "pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilize all\n",
      "the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself\n",
      "implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge,\n",
      "which, even in these days of free education and encyclopaedias,\n",
      "is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so impossible,\n",
      "however, that a man should possess all knowledge which is\n",
      "likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have endeav-\n",
      "oured in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you on one\n",
      "occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits\n",
      "in a very precise fashion.\"\n",
      "  \"Yes,\" I answered, laughing. \"It was a singular document.\n",
      "Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I\n",

      "mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry\n",
      "eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime\n",
      "records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and\n",
      "self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the\n",
      "main points of my analysis.\"\n",
      "  Holmes grinned at the last item. \"Well,\" he said, \"I say\n",
      "now, as I said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic\n",
      "stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest\n",
      "he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he can\n",
      "get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the one which has\n",
      "been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster all our\n",
      "resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the American\n",
      "Encyclopaedia which stands upon the shelf beside you. Thank\n",
      "you. Now let us consider the situation and see what may be\n",
      "deduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a strong\n",
      "presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong rea-\n",
      "son for leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change\n",
      "all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of\n",
      "Florida for the lonely life of an English provincial town. His\n",
      "extreme love of solitude in England suggests the idea that he was\n",
      "in fear of someone or something, so we may assume as a\n",
      "working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something\n",
      "which drove him from America. As to what it was he feared, we\n",
      "can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which\n",
      "were received by himself and his successors. Did you remark the\n",
      "postmarks of those letters?\"\n",
      "  \"The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee,\n",
      "and the third from London.\"\n",
      "  \"From East London. What do you deduce from that?\"\n",
      "  \"They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a\n",
      "ship.\"\n",
      "  \"Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt\n",
      "that the probability -- the strong probability -- is that the writer\n",
      "was on board of a ship. And now let us consider another point.\n",
      "In the case of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the\n",
      "threat and its fulfillment, in Dundee it was only some three or\n",
      "four days. Does that suggest anything?\"\n",
      "  \"A greater distance to travel.\"\n",
      "  \"But the letter had also a greater distance to come.\"\n",
      "  \"Then I do not see the point.\"\n",
      "  \"There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the\n",
      "man or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always seni\n",
      "their singular warning or token before them when starting upon\n",
      "their mission. You see how quickly the deed followed the sign\n",
      "when it came from Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry\n",
      "in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their\n",
      "letter. But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that\n",
      "those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-\n",
      "boat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought\n",
      "the writer.\"\n",
      "  \"It is possible.\"\n",
      "  \"More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly\n",
      "urgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to\n",
      "caution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which\n",
      "it would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one\n",
      "comes from London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay.\"\n",
      "  \"Good God!\" I cried. \"What can it mean, this relentless\n",
      "persecution?\"\n",
      "  \"The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital\n",
      "importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think\n",
      "that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them. A\n",
      "single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way\n",
      "as to deceive a coroner's jury. There must have been several in\n",
      "it, and they must have been men of resource and determination.\n",
      "Their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it\n",
      "may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an\n",
      "individual and becomes the badge of a society.\"\n",
      "  \"But of what society?\"\n",
      "  \"Have you never --\" said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward\n",
      "and sinking his voice --\"have you never heard of the Ku Klux\n",
      "Klan?\"\n",
      "  \"I never have.\"\n",
      "  Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee.\n",
      "\"Here it is,\" said he presently:\n",
      "\n",
      "      \"Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resem-\n",
      "    blance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This\n",
      "    terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate\n",
      "    soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War, and it\n",
      "    rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the\n",
      "    country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas,\n",
      "    Georgia, and Florida. Its power was used for political\n",
      "    purposes, principally for the terrorizing of the negro vot-\n",
      "    ers and the murdering and driving from the country of\n",
      "    those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were\n",
      "    usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in\n",
      "    some fantastic but generally recognized shape -- a sprig of\n",
      "    oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in\n",
      "    others. On receiving this the victim might either openly\n",
      "    abjure his former ways, or might fly from the country. If\n",
      "    he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come\n",
      "    upon him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen\n",
      "    manner. So perfect was the organization of the society,\n",
      "    and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a case\n",
      "    upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with\n",
      "    impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced\n",
      "    home to the perpetrators. For some years the organization\n",
      "    flourished in spite of the efforts of the United States\n",
      "    government and of the better classes of the community in\n",
      "    the South. Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement\n",
      "    rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been spo-\n",
      "    radic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"You will observe,\" said Holmes, laying down the volume,\n",
      "\"that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with\n",
      "the disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers.\n",
      "It may well have been cause and effect. It is no wonder that he\n",
      "and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon\n",
      "their track. You can understand that this register and diary may\n",
      "implicate some of the first men in the South, and that there may\n",
      "be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered.\"\n",

      "left the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a\n",
      "sinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some\n",
      "light into this dark place, and I believe that the only chance\n",
      "young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have told\n",
      "him. There is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so\n",

      "the bridge. He survived by asking the passers-by for food and, after two \n",
      "years, thought that the authorities had probably forgotten him. He then headed\n",
      "towards the capital, where he would ask the King for all his back pay. His \n",
      "pockets were empty and his only possessions were a pipe, a bit of tobacco and \n",
      "his sword.\n",
      "   A couple of days later he arrived in a valley where a stream crossed his \n",
      "path. A big man with hands as big as hams, large shoulders and a bull's neck \n",
      "was sitting by the stream. The man, who had a strangely soft and kind voice, \n",
      "asked him:\n",
      "   \"Would you like to cross the stream?\" The soldier couldn't ask for more. \n",
      "The man effortlessly uprooted a huge tree and laid it across the stream. \n",
      "Martin offered the man some of his tobacco in return and when he found out \n",
      "that the man had nothing to do, Martin asked him to come along.\n",
      "   \"You'll see all the things we can do together!\"\n",
      "   They had just begun walking away when they met a hunter who was aiming his \n",
      "rifle at a faraway hill.\n",
      "   \"What are you aiming at?\"\n",
      "   \"Do you see that cobweb on that tree on top of the hill?\" the hunter asked.\n",
      "\"I want to get the spider!\" The hunter shot and when the three men got to the \n",
      "top of the hill they found a big hole in the middle of the cobweb and no more \n",
      "spider. Martin had never seen anyone shoot that well and he asked the hunter \n",
      "to join them. \n",
      "   \"Come with us and you'll be in luck!\" The three men walked and walked until\n",
      "they arrived at a windmill. The wheel of the mill was turning even though \n",
      "there was no wind. The men were puzzled but further up the road they found a \n",
      "fat man sitting on a tree stump. The man was blowing through one of his \n",
      "nostrils in the mill's direction. The fat man explained to the three amazed \n",
      "fellow travellers that his strength was such that he could sneeze up a \n",
      "hurricane. The soldier convinced him to follow them. As they approached the \n",
      "city, they were approached by a man who hopped about with his legs tied \n",
      "together.\n",
      "   \"Who tied you up?\" they asked in unison.\n",
      "   \"I did it myself,\" the man, who was very young and very thin, answered. \"If\n",
      "I untied myself I would run as fast as the wind and would not enjoy the \n",
      "sights.\" And so it was that even this character, nicknamed Fastfoot by the \n",
      "others, joined the group. \n",
      "   But the surprises of that extraordinary day were far from over. A little \n",
      "man with a round face sat under a tree. He held his hat over his left ear. \"If\n",
      "I straighten my hat,\" he explained, \"I will freeze everything around me.\" \n",
      "Naturally, everybody took his word for it and the stranger was asked to join \n",
      "the group. The bizarre company finally arrived at the city. A public notice \n",
      "was hung outside the city walls. The princess announced that whoever would \n",
      "beat her in a race could marry her. \n",
      "   The soldier dusted his uniform, cleaned himself up after the long trip and \n",
      "ran to the palace. He wanted to challenge the princess but said that one of \n",
      "his servants would run in his place. The princess accepted his challenge. The \n",
      "morning after, at the starting line, Fastfoot untied his legs and took off \n",
      "like a rocket. Each one of the contestants had a jug that had to be filled at \n",
      "a nearby stream and brought back full to the finish line. On his way back, \n",
      "Fastfoot stopped to pick a flower and after carefully setting the jug on the \n",
      "ground and realizing that the princess was still far away, he decided to lie \n",
      "down and rest for a while. Unfortunately, he fell asleep.\n",
      "   Later on, when the princess caught up with him and saw that he had fallen \n",
      "asleep, she kicked down his jug and ran away. She was sure of her victory. \n",
      "From far away the sharp sighted hunter shot and hit a spot near Fastfoot's \n",
      "ear. Fastfoot woke up all of a sudden and saw the princess approaching the \n",
      "finish line. He quickly ran back to the stream, filled the jug and reached the\n",
      "finish line as fast as lightning. The King was furious. He would never let his\n",
      "daughter marry a miserable soldier.\n",
      "   He invited the unsuspecting Martin to the palace. Martin told him about his\n",
      "two years watching over the river, which made the King ever angrier. The King,\n",
      "however, pretended to feel guilty and invited the soldier and his friends to a\n",
      "banquet in a strange dining room. In fact the dining room was lined with iron \n",
      "walls and was built over a huge furnace. The King ordered his men to seal the \n",
      "dining room's door and to light the furnace. Then he proceeded to watch the \n",
      "slow death of the group through an unbreakable glass. The six men began eating\n",
      "but suddenly felt the floor grow very hot, while the room's temperature \n",
      "rapidly increased.\n",
      "   But Martin did not lose his head. He straightened the hat of the round \n",
      "faced little man and pretty soon they were all shivering from the cold. The \n",
      "King uselessly urged his men to throw more and more wood in the furnace, but \n",
      "the soldier and his fnends had found a remedy to the King's wickedness. No one\n",
      "had ever come out of this torture chamber alive, but this time the King had to\n",
      "accept defeat, even though he was still determined not to let his daughter go.\n",
      "He offered the soldier a large sum of money as long as he gave up the wedding.\n",
      "   \"I will fill you a bag of gold and other riches if you forget the wedding.\"\n",
      "   \"That's fine with me,\" Martin said, \"and I accept your offer but as long as\n",
      "I pick the bag and the man who will carry it away.\" The poor King was unaware \n",
      "of the strength of one of the six friends. When he began filling the sack, all\n",
      "of his gold was not enough to fill it. Martin and his friends were rich. When \n",
      "they left court, the King had become very poor.\n",
      "   The monarch lost his temper and realized the soldier had fooled him. He \n",
      "called the army commander and ordered two battalions to chase Martin. \"Bring \n",
      "them back dead or alive and at all costs!\" Later on, the soldiers caught up \n",
      "with the six young men and surrounded them.\n",
      "   \"Give us back the gold and surrender,\" they demanded. But the fattest of the\n",
      "men began blowing so hard that horses and soldiers were carried away. In just a\n",
      "few minutes the wounded soldiers were scattered all over the plain and the\n",
      "battalions were no longer a threat to the six extraordinary friends who \n",
      "continued their journey. \n",
      "   Then they divided the gold and jewels in equal parts and each one of them \n",
      "went his own separate way. Martin crossed the bridge where he had been on \n",
      "watch for so long without any reward and never turned back again.\n",

      "with all that was going on at the police headquarters. In return\n",
      "for the news which Lestrde would bring, Holmes was always\n",
      "ready to listen with attention to the details of any case upon\n",
      "which the detective was engaged, and was able occasionally\n",
      "without any active interference, to give some hint or suggestion\n",
      "drawn from his own vast knowledge and experience.\n",
      "  On this particular evening, Lestrade had spoken of the weather\n",
      "and the newspapers. Then he had fallen silent, puffing thoughtfully\n",
      "at his cigar. Holmes looked keenly at him.\n",
      "  \"Anything remarkable on hand?\" he asked.\n",

      "although it is trivial, it is undoubtedly queer, and I know that\n",
      "you have a taste for all that is out of the common. But, in my\n",

      "that brings it away from the doctor and on to the policeman.\"\n",
      "  Holmes sat up again.\n",
      "  \"Burglary! This is more interesting. Let me hear the details.\"\n",
      "  Lestrade took out his official notebook and refreshed his mem-\n",
      "ory from its pages.\n",
      "  \"The first case reported was four days ago,\" said he. \"It was\n",
      "at the shop of Morse Hudson, who has a place for the sale of\n",
      "pictures and statues in the Kennington Road. The assistant had\n",
      "left the front shop for an instant, when he heard a crash, and\n",
      "hurrying in he found a plaster bust of Napoleon, which stood\n",
      "with several other works of art upon the counter, lying shivered\n",
      "into fragments. He rushed out into the road, but, although sev-\n",
      "eral passers-by declared that they had noticed a man run out of\n",
      "the shop, he could neither see anyone nor could he find any\n",
      "means of identifying the rascal. It seemed to be one of those\n",
      "senseless acts of Hooliganism which occur from time to time,\n",
      "and it was reported to the constable on the beat as such. The\n",
      "plaster cast was not worth more than a few shillings, and the\n",
      "whole affair appeared to be too childish for any particular\n",
      "investigation.\n",
      "  \"The second case, however, was more serious, and also more\n",
      "singular. It occurred only last night.\n",
      "  \"In Kennington Road, and within a few hundred yards of\n",
      "Morse Hudson's shop, there lives a well-known medical practi-\n",
      "tioner, named Dr. Barnicot, who has one of the largest practices\n",
      "upon the south side of the Thames. His residence and principal\n",
      "consulting-room is at Kennington Road, but he has a branch\n",
      "surgery and dispensary at Lower Brixton Road, two miles away.\n",
      "This Dr. Barnicot is an enthusiastic admirer of Napoleon, and his\n",
      "house is full of books, pictures, and relics of the French Em-\n",
      "peror. Some little time ago he purchased from Morse Hudson\n",
      "two duplicate plaster casts of the famous head of Napoleon by\n",
      "the French sculptor, Devine. One of these he placed in his hall in\n",
      "the house at Kennington Road, and the other on the mantelpiece\n",
      "of the surgery at Lower Brixton. Well, when Dr. Barnicot came\n",
      "down this morning he was astonished to find that his house had\n",
      "been burgled during the night, but that nothing had been taken\n",
      "save the plaster head from the hall. It had been carried out and\n",
      "had been dashed savagely against the garden wall, under which\n",
      "its splintered fragments were discovered.\"\n",
      "  Holmes rubbed his hands.\n",
      "  \"This is certainly very novel,\" said he.\n",
      "  \"I thought it would please you. But I have not got to the end\n",
      "yet. Dr. Barnicot was due at his surgery at twelve o'clock, and\n",
      "you can imagine his amazement when, on arriving there, he\n",
      "found that the window had been opened in the night, and that the\n",
      "broken pieces of his second bust were strewn all over the room.\n",
      "It had been smashed to atoms where it stood. In neither case\n",
      "were there any signs which could give us a clue as to the\n",
      "criminal or lunatic who had done the mischief. Now, Mr. Holmes,\n",
      "you have got the facts.\"\n",
      "  \"They are singular, not to say grotesque,\" said Holmes.\n",
      "\"May I ask whether the two busts smashed in Dr. Barnicot's\n",
      "rooms were the exact duplicates of the one which was destroyed\n",
      "in Morse Hudson's shop?\"\n",
      "  \"They were taken from the same mould.\"\n",
      "  \"Such a fact must tell against the theory that the man who\n",
      "breaks them is influenced by any general hatred of Napoleon.\n",
      "Considering how many hundreds of statues of the great Emperor\n",
      "must exist in London, it is too much to suppose such a coinci-\n",
      "dence as that a promiscuous iconoclast should chance to begin\n",
      "upon three specimens of the same bust.\"\n",
      "  \"Well, I thought as you do,\" said Lestrade. \"On the other\n",
      "hand, this Morse Hudson is the purveyor of busts in that part of\n",
      "London, and these three were the only ones which had been in\n",
      "his shop for years. So, although, as you say, there are many\n",
      "hundreds of statues in London, it is very probable that these\n",
      "three were the only ones in that district. Therefore, a local\n",
      "fanatic would begin with them. What do you think, Dr. Watson?\"\n",
      "  \"There are no limits to the possibilities of monomania,\" I\n",
      "answered. \"There is the condition which the modern French\n",
      "psychologists have called the 'idee fixe,' which may be trifling in\n",
      "character, and accompanied by complete sanity in every other\n",
      "way. A man who had read deeply about Napoleon, or who had\n",
      "possibly received some hereditary family injury through the great\n",
      "war, might conceivably form such an idee fixe and under its\n",
      "influence be capable of any fantastic outrage.\"\n",
      "  \"That won't do, my dear Watson,\" said Holmes, shaking his\n",
      "head, \"for no amount of idee fixe would enable your interesting\n",
      "monomaniac to find out where these busts were situated.\"\n",
      "  \"Well, how do you explain it?\"\n",
      "  \"I don't attempt to do so. I would only observe that there is a\n",
      "certain method in the gentleman's eccentric proceedings. For\n",
      "example, in Dr. Barnicot's hall, where a sound might arouse the\n",
      "family, the bust was taken outside before being broken, whereas\n",
      "in the surgery, where there was less danger of an alarm, it was\n",
      "smashed where it stood. The affair seems absurdly trifling, and\n",
      "yet I dare call nothing trivial when I reflect that some of my most\n",
      "classic cases have had the least promising commencement. You\n",
      "will remember, Watson, how the dreadful business of the Abernetty\n",
      "family was first brought to my notice by the depth which the\n",
      "parsley had sunk into the butter upon a hot day. I can't afford,\n",
      "therefore, to smile at your three broken busts, Lestrade, and I\n",
      "shall be very much obliged to you if you will let me hear of any\n",
      "fresh development of so singular a chain of events.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "  The development for which my friend had asked came in a\n",
      "quicker and an infinitely more tragic form than he could have\n",
      "imagined. I was still dressing in my bedroom next morning,\n",
      "when there was a tap at the door and Holmes entered, a\n",
      "telegram in his hand. He read it aloud:\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Come instantly, 131 Pitt Street, Kensington.\n",

      "\n",
      "  \"What is it, then?\" I asked.\n",
      "  \"Don't know -- may be anything. But I suspect it is the sequel\n",

      "breaker has begun operations in another quarter of London.\n",
      "There's coffee on the table, Watson, and I have a cab at the\n",

      "  \"It's the Napoleon bust business again,\" said Lestrade. \"You\n",

      "news has come my own way I am so confused and bothered that\n",
      "I can't put two words together. If I had come in here as a\n",
      "journalist, I should have interviewed myself and had two col-\n",
      "umns in every evening paper. As it is, I am giving away valu-\n",

      "explain this queer business, I shall be paid for my trouble in\n",
      "telling you the story.\"\n",
      "  Holmes sat down and listened.\n",
      "  \"It all seems to centre round that bust of Napoleon which I\n",
      "bought for this very room about four months ago. I picked it up\n",
      "cheap from Harding Brothers, two doors from the High Street\n",
      "Station. A great deal of my journalistic work is done at night,\n",
      "and I often write until the early morning. So it was to-day. I was\n",
      "sitting in my den, which is at the back of the top of the house,\n",
      "about three o'clock, when I was convinced that l heard some\n",
      "sounds downstairs. I listened, but they were not repeated, and I\n",
      "concluded that they came from outside. Then suddenly, about\n",
      "five minutes later, there came a most horrible yell -- the most\n",
      "dreadful sound, Mr. Holmes, that ever I heard. It will ring in my\n",
      "ears as long as I live. I sat frozen with horror for a minute or\n",
      "two. Then I seized the poker and went downstairs. When I\n",
      "entered this room I found the window wide open, and I at once\n",
      "observed that the bust was gone from the mantelpiece. Why any\n",
      "burglar should take such a thing passes my understanding, for it\n",
      "was only a plaster cast and of no real value whatever.\n",
      "  \"You can see for yourself that anyone going out through that\n",
      "open window could reach the front doorstep by taking a long\n",
      "stride. This was clearly what the burglar had done, so I went\n",
      "round and opened the door. Stepping out into the dark, I nearly\n",
      "fell over a dead man, who was lying there. I ran back for a light,\n",
      "and there was the poor fellow, a great gash in his throat and the\n",
      "whole place swimming in blood. He lay on his back, his knees\n",
      "drawn up, and his mouth horribly open. I shall see him in my\n",
      "dreams. I had just time to blow on my police-whistle, and then I\n",
      "must have fainted, for I knew nothing more until I found the\n",
      "policeman standing over me in the hall.\"\n",
      "  \"Well, who was the murdered man?\" asked Holmes.\n",
      "  \"There's nothing to show who he was,\" said Lestrade. \"You\n",
      "shall see the body at the mortuary, but we have made nothing of\n",
      "it up to now. He is a tall man, sunburned, very powerful, not\n",
      "more than thirty. He is poorly dressed, and yet does not appear\n",
      "to be a labourer. A horn-handled clasp knife was lying in a pool\n",
      "of blood beside him. Whether it was the weapon which did the\n",
      "deed, or whether it belonged to the dead man, I do not know.\n",
      "There was no name on his clothing, and nothing in his pockets\n",
      "save an apple, some string, a shilling map of London, and a\n",
      "photograph. Here it is.\"\n",
      "  It was evidently taken by a snapshot from a small camera. It\n",
      "represented an alert, sharp-featured simian man. with thick eye-\n",
      "brows and a very peculiar projection of the lower part of the\n",
      "face, like the muzzle of a baboon.\n",
      "  \"And what became of the bust?\" asked Holmes, after a\n",
      "careful study of this picture.\n",
      "  \"We had news of it just before you came. It has been found in\n",
      "the front garden of an empty house in Campden House Road. It\n",
      "was broken into fragments. I am going round now to see it. Will\n",
      "you come?\"\n",
      "  \"Certainly. I must just take one look round.\" He examined\n",
      "the carpet and the window. \"The fellow had either very long\n",
      "legs or was a most active man,\" said he. \"With an area beneath,\n",
      "it was no mean feat to reach that window-ledge and open that\n",
      "window. Getting back was comparatively simple. Are you com-\n",
      "ing with us to see the remains of your bust, Mr. Harker?\"\n",
      "  The disconsolate journalist had seated himself at a writing-table.\n",
      "  \"I must try and make something of it,\" said he, \"though I\n",
      "have no doubt that the first editions of the evening papers are out\n",
      "already with full details. It's like my luck! You remember when\n",
      "the stand fell at Doncaster? Well, I was the only journalist in the\n",
      "stand, and my journal the only one that had no account of it, for\n",
      "I was too shaken to write it. And now I'll be too late with a\n",
      "murder done on my own doorstep.\"\n",
      "  As we left the room, we heard his pen travelling shrilly over\n",
      "the foolscap.\n",
      "  The spot where the fragments of the bust had been found was\n",
      "only a few hundred yards away. For the first time our eyes rested\n",
      "upon this presentment of the great emperor, which seemed to\n",
      "raise such frantic and destructive hatred in the mind of the\n",
      "unknown. It lay scattered, in splintered shards, upon the grass.\n",
      "Holmes picked up several of them and examined them carefully.\n",
      "I was convinced, from his intent face and his purposeful manner,\n",
      "that at last he was upon a clue.\n",
      "  \"Well?\" asked Lestrade.\n",
      "  Holmes shrugged his shoulders.\n",
      "  \"We have a long way to go yet,\" said he. \"And yet -- and\n",
      "yet -- well, we have some suggestive facts to act upon. The\n",
      "possession of this trifling bust was worth more, in the eyes of\n",
      "this strange criminal, than a human life. That is one point. Then\n",
      "there is the singular fact that he did not break it in the house, or\n",
      "immediately outside the house, if to break it was his sole object.\"\n",
      "  \"He was rattled and bustled by meeting this other fellow. He\n",
      "hardly knew what he was doing.\"\n",
      "  \"Well, that's likely enough. But I wish to call your attention\n",
      "very particularly to the position of this house, in the garden of\n",
      "which the bust was destroyed.\"\n",
      "  Lestrade looked about him.\n",
      "  \"It was an empty house, and so he knew that he would not be\n",
      "disturbed in the garden.\"\n",
      "  \"Yes, but there is another empty house farther up the street\n",
      "which he must have passed before he came to this one. Why did\n",
      "he not break it there, since it is evident that every yard that he\n",
      "carried it increased the risk of someone meeting him?\"\n",
      "  \"I give it up,\" said Lestrade.\n",
      "  Holmes pointed to the street lamp above our heads.\n",
      "  \"He could see what he was doing here, and he could not\n",
      "there. That was his reason.\"\n",
      "  \"By Jove! that's true,\" said the detective. \"Now that I come\n",
      "to think of it, Dr. Barnicot's bust was broken not far from his red\n",
      "lamp. Well, Mr. Holmes, what are we to do with that fact?\"\n",
      "  \"To remember it -- to docket it. We may come on something\n",
      "later which will bear upon it. What steps do you propose to take\n",
      "now, Lestrade?\"\n",
      "  \"The most practical way of getting at it, in my opinion, is to\n",
      "identify the dead man. There should be no difficulty about that.\n",
      "When we have found who he is and who his associates are, we\n",
      "should have a good start in learning what he was doing in Pitt\n",
      "Street last night, and who it was who met him and killed him on\n",
      "the doorstep of Mr. Horace Harker. Don't you think so?\"\n",
      "  \"No doubt; and yet it is not quite the way in which I should\n",
      "approach the case.\"\n",
      "  \"What would you do then?\"\n",
      "  \"Oh, you must not let me influence you in any way. I suggest\n",
      "that you go on your line and I on mine. We can compare notes\n",
      "afterwards, and each will supplement the other.\"\n",
      "  \"Very good,\" said Lestrade.\n",
      "  \"If you are going back to Pitt Street, you might see Mr.\n",
      "Horace Harker. Tell him for me that I have quite made up my\n",
      "mind, and that it is certain that a dangerous homicidal lunatic,\n",
      "with Napoleonic delusions, was in his house last night. It will be\n",
      "useful for his article.\"\n",
      "  Lestrade stared.\n",
      "  \"You don't seriously believe that?\"\n",
      "  Holmes smiled.\n",
      "  \"Don't I? Well, perhaps I don't. But I am sure that it will\n",
      "interest Mr. Horace Harker and the subscribers of the Central\n",
      "Press Syndicate. Now, Watson, I think that we shall find that we\n",
      "have a long and rather complex day's work before us. I should\n",
      "be glad, Lestrade, if you could make it convenient to meet us at\n",
      "Baker Street at six o'clock this evening. Until then I should like\n",
      "to keep this photograph, found in the dead man's pocket. It is\n",
      "possible that I may have to ask your company and assistance\n",
      "upon a small expedition which will have to be undertaken to-\n",
      "night, if my chain of reasoning should prove to be correct. Until\n",
      "then good-bye and good luck!\"\n",
      "  Sherlock Holmes and I walked together to the High Street,\n",
      "where we stopped at the shop of Harding Brothers, whence the\n",
      "bust had been purchased. A young assistant informed us that Mr.\n",
      "Harding would be absent until afternoon, and that he was himself\n",
      "a newcomer, who could give us no information. Holmes's face\n",
      "showed his disappointment and annoyance.\n",
      "  \"Well, well, we can't expect to have it all our own way,\n",
      "Watson,\" he said, at last. \"We must come back in the after-\n",
      "noon, if Mr. Harding will not be here until then. I am, as you\n",
      "have no doubt surmised, endeavouring to trace these busts to\n",
      "their source, in order to find if there is not something peculiar\n",
      "which may account for their remarkable fate. Let us make for\n",
      "Mr. Morse Hudson, of the Kennington Road, and see if he can\n",
      "throw any light upon the problem.\"\n",
      "  A drive of an hour brought us to the picture-dealer's establish-\n",
      "ment. He was a small, stout man with a red face and a peppery\n",
      "manner.\n",
      "  \"Yes, sir. On my very counter, sir,\" said he. \"What we pay\n",
      "rates and taxes for I don't know, when any ruffian can come in\n",
      "and break one's goods. Yes, sir, it was I who sold Dr. Barnicot\n",
      "his two statues. Disgraceful, sir! A Nihilist plot -- that's what I\n",
      "make it. No one but an anarchist would go about breaking\n",
      "statues. Red republicans -- that's what I call 'em. Who did I get\n",
      "the statues from? I don't see what that has to do with it. Welll, if\n",
      "you really want to know, I got them from Gelder & Co., in\n",
      "Church Street, Stepney. They are a well-known house in the\n",
      "trade, and have been this twenty years. How many had l?\n",
      "Three -- two and one are three -- two of Dr. Barnicot's, and one\n",
      "smashed in broad daylight on my own counter. Do I know that\n",
      "photograph? No, I don't. Yes, I do, though. Why, it's Beppo.\n",
      "He was a kind of Italian piece-work man, who made himself\n",
      "useful in the shop. He could carve a bit, and gild and frame, and\n",
      "do odd jobs. The fellow left me last week, and I've heard\n",
      "nothing of him since. No, I don't know where he came from nor\n",
      "where he went to. I had nothing against him while he was here.\n",
      "He was gone two days before the bust was smashed.\"\n",
      "  \"Well, that's all we could reasonably expect from Morse\n",
      "Hudson,\" said Holmes, as we emerged from the shop. \"We\n",
      "have this Beppo as a common factor, both in Kennington and in\n",
      "Kensington, so that is worth a ten-mile drive. Now, Watson, let\n",
      "us make for Gelder & Co., of Stepney, the source and origin of\n",
      "the busts. I shall be surprised if we don't get some help down\n",
      "there.\"\n",
      "  In rapid succession we passed through the fringe of fashion-\n",
      "able London, hotel London, theatrical London, literary London,\n",
      "commercial London, and, finally, maritime London, till we came\n",
      "to a riverside city of a hundred thousand souls, where the\n",
      "tenement houses swelter and reek with the outcasts of Europe.\n",
      "Here, in a broad thoroughfare, once the abode of wealthy City\n",
      "merchants, we found the sculpture works for which we searched.\n",
      "Outside was a considerable yard full of monumental masonry.\n",
      "Inside was a large room in which fifty workers were carving or\n",
      "moulding. The manager, a big blond German, received us civilly\n",
      "and gave a clear answer to all Holmes's questions. A reference\n",
      "to his books showed that hundreds of casts had been taken from\n",
      "a marble copy of Devine's head of Napoleon, but that the three\n",
      "which had been sent to Morse Hudson a year or so before had\n",
      "been half of a batch of six, the other three being sent to Harding\n",
      "Brothers, of Kensington. There was no reason why those six\n",
      "should be different from any of the other casts. He could suggest\n",
      "no possible cause why anyone should wish to destroy them -- in\n",
      "fact, he laughed at the idea. Their wholesale price was six\n",
      "shillings, but the retailer would get twelve or more. The cast\n",
      "was taken in two moulds from each side of the face, and then\n",
      "these two profiles of plaster of Paris were joined together to\n",
      "make the complete bust. The work was usually done by Italians,\n",
      "in the room we were in. When finished, the busts were put on a\n",
      "table in the passage to dry, and afterwards stored. That was all\n",
      "he could tell us.\n",
      "  But the production of the photograph had a remarkable effect\n",
      "upon the manager. His face flushed with anger, and his brows\n",
      "knotted over his blue Teutonic eyes.\n",
      "  \"Ah, the rascal!\" he cried. \"Yes, indeed, I know him very\n",
      "well. This has always been a respectable establishment, and the\n",
      "only time that we have ever had the police in it was over this\n",
      "very fellow. It was more than a year ago now. He knifed another\n",
      "Italian in the street, and then he came to the works with the\n",
      "police on his heels, and he was taken here. Beppo was his\n",
      "name -- his second name I never knew. Serve me right for engag-\n",
      "ing a man with such a face. But he was a good workman -- one\n",
      "of the best.\"\n",
      "  \"What did he get?\"\n",
      "  \"The man lived and he got off with a year. I have no doubt he\n",
      "is out now, but he has not dared to show his nose here. We have\n",
      "a cousin of his here, and I daresay he could tell you where he\n",
      "is.\"\n",
      "  \"No, no,\" cried Holmes, \"not a word to the cousin -- not a\n",
      "word, I beg of you. The matter is very important, and the farther\n",
      "I go with it, the more important it seems to grow. When you\n",
      "referred in your ledger to the sale of those casts I observed that\n",
      "the date was June 3rd of last year. Could you give me the date\n",
      "when Beppo was arrested?\"\n",
      "  \"I could tell you roughly by the pay-list,\" the manager an-\n",
      "swered. \"Yes,\" he continued, after some turning over of pages,\n",
      "\"he was paid last on May 20th.\"\n",
      "  \"Thank you,\" said Holmes. \"I don't think that I need intrude\n",
      "upon your time and patience any more.\" With a last word of\n",
      "caution that he should say nothing as to our researches, we\n",
      "turned our faces westward once more.\n",
      "  The afternoon was far advanced before we were able to snatch\n",
      "a hasty luncheon at a restaurant. A news-bill at the entrance\n",
      "announced \"Kensington Outrage. Murder by a Madman,\" and\n",
      "the contents of the paper showed that Mr. Horace Harker had got\n",
      "his account into print after all. Two columns were occupied with\n",
      "a highly sensational and flowery rendering of the whole incident.\n",
      "Holmes propped it against the cruet-stand and read it while he\n",
      "ate. Once or twice he chuckled.\n",
      "  \"This is all right, Watson,\" said he. \"Listen to this:\n",
      "\n",
      "      \"It is satisfactory to know that there can be no difference\n",
      "    of opinion upon this case, since Mr. Lestrade, one of the\n",
      "    most experienced members of the official force, and Mr.\n",
      "    Sherlock Holmes, the well-known consulting expert, have\n",
      "    each come to the conclusion that the grotesque series of\n",
      "    incidents, which have ended in so tragic a fashion, arise\n",
      "    from lunacy rather than from deliberate crime. No explana-\n",
      "    tion save mental aberration can cover the facts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Press, Watson, is a most valuable institution. if you only\n",
      "know how to use it. And now, if you have quite finished, we\n",
      "will hark back to Kensington and see what the manager of\n",
      "Harding Brothers has to say on the matter.\"\n",
      "  The founder of that great emporium proved to be a brisk, crisp\n",
      "little person, very dapper and quick, with a clear head and a\n",
      "ready tongue.\n",
      "  \"Yes, sir, I have already read the account in the evening\n",
      "papers. Mr. Horace Harker is a customer of ours. We supplied\n",
      "him with the bust some months ago. We ordered three busts of\n",
      "that sort from Gelder & Co., of Stepney. They are all sold now.\n",
      "To whom? Oh, I daresay by consulting our sales book we could\n",
      "very easily tell you. Yes, we have the entries here. One to Mr.\n",
      "Harker you see, and one to Mr. Josiah Brown, of Laburnum\n",
      "Lodge, Laburnum Vale, Chiswick, and one to Mr. Sandeford, of\n",
      "Lower Grove Road, Reading. No, I have never seen this face\n",
      "which you show me in the photograph. You would hardly forget\n",
      "it, would you, sir, for I've seldom seen an uglier. Have we any\n",
      "Italians on the staff? Yes, sir, we have several among our\n",
      "workpeople and cleaners. I daresay they might get a peep at that\n",
      "sales book if they wanted to. There is no particular reason for\n",
      "keeping a watch upon that book. Well, well, it's a very strange\n",
      "business, and I hope that you will let me know if anything comes\n",
      "of your inquiries.\"\n",
      "  Holmes had taken several notes during Mr. Harding's evi-\n",
      "dence, and I could see that he was thoroughly satisfied by the\n",
      "turn which affairs were taking. He made no remark, however\n",
      "save that, unless we hurried, we should be late for our appoint-\n",
      "ment with Lestrade. Sure enough, when we reached Baker Street\n",
      "the detective was already there, and we found him pacing up and\n",
      "down in a fever of impatience. His look of importance showed\n",
      "that his day's work had not been in vain.\n",
      "  \"Well?\" he asked. \"What luck, Mr. Holmes?\"\n",
      "  \"We have had a very busy day, and not entirely a wasted\n",
      "one,\" my friend explained. \"We have seen both the retailers and\n",
      "also the wholesale manufacturers. I can trace each of the busts\n",
      "now from the beginning.\"\n",
      "  \"The busts!\" cried Lestrade. \"Well, well, you have your own\n",
      "methods, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and it is not for me to say a\n",
      "word against them, but I think I have done a better day's work\n",
      "than you. I have identified the dead man.\"\n",
      "  \"You don't say so?\"\n",
      "  \"And found a cause for the crime.\"\n",
      "  \"Splendid!\"\n",
      "  \"We have an inspector who makes a specialty of Saffron Hill\n",
      "and the Italian quarter. Well, this dead man had some Catholic\n",
      "emblem round his neck. and that, along with his colour, made\n",
      "me think he was from the South. Inspector Hill knew him the\n",
      "moment he caught sight of him. His name is Pietro Venucci,\n",
      "from Naples, and he is one of the greatest cut-throats in Lon-\n",
      "don. He is connected with the Mafia, which, as you know, is a\n",
      "secret political society, enforcing its decrees by murder. Now,\n",
      "you see how the affair begins to clear up. The other fellow is\n",
      "probably an Italian also, and a member of the Mafia. He has\n",
      "broken the rules in some fashion. Pietro is set upon his track.\n",
      "Probably the photograph we found in his pocket is the man him-\n",
      "self, so that he may not knife the wrong person. He dogs the\n",
      "fellow, he sees him enter a house, he waits outside for him, and\n",
      "in the scuffle he receives his own death-wound. How is that, Mr.\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes?\"\n",
      "  Holmes clapped his hands approvingly.\n",
      "  \"Excellent, Lestrade, excellent!\" he cried. \"But I didn't quite\n",
      "follow your explanation of the destruction of the busts.\"\n",
      "  \"The busts! You never can get those busts out of your head.\n",
      "After all, that is nothing; petty larceny, six months at the most. It\n",
      "is the murder that we are really investigating, and I tell you that I\n",
      "am gathering all the threads into my hands.\"\n",
      "  \"And the next stage?\"\n",
      "  \"Is a very simple one. I shall go down with Hill to the Italian\n",
      "Quarter, find the man whose photograph we have got, and arrest\n",
      "him on the charge of murder. Will you come with us?\"\n",
      "  \"I think not. I fancy we can attain our end in a simpler way. I\n",
      "can't say for certain, because it all depends -- well, it all depends\n",
      "upon a factor which is completely outside our control. But I have\n",
      "great hopes -- in fact, the betting is exactly two to one -- that if\n",
      "you will come with us to-night I shall be able to help you to lay\n",
      "him by the heels.\"\n",
      "  \"In the Italian Quarter?\"\n",
      "  \"No, I fancy Chiswick is an address which is more likely to\n",
      "find him. If you will come with me to Chiswick to-night,\n",
      "Lestrade, I'll promise to go to the Italian Quarter with you\n",
      "to-morrow, and no harm will be done by the delay. And now I\n",
      "think that a few hours' sleep would do us all good, for I do not\n",
      "propose to leave before eleven o'clock, and it is unlikely that we\n",
      "shall be back before morning. You'll dine with us, Lestrade, and\n",
      "then you are welcome to the sofa until it is time for us to start. In\n",
      "the meantime, Watson, I should be glad if you would ring for an\n",
      "express messenger, for I have a letter to send and it is imponant\n",
      "that it should go at once.\"\n",
      "  Holmes spent the evening in rummaging among the files of the\n",
      "old daily papers with which one of our lumber-rooms was packed.\n",
      "When at last he descended, it was with triumph in his eyes, but\n",
      "he said nothing to either of us as to the result of his researches.\n",
      "For my own part, I had followed step by step the methods by\n",
      "which he had traced the various windings of this complex case,\n",
      "and, though I could not yet perceive the goal which we would\n",
      "reach, I understood clearly that Holmes expected this grotesque\n",
      "criminal to make an attempt upon the two remaining busts, one\n",
      "of which, I remembered, was at Chiswick. No doubt the object\n",
      "of our journey was to catch him in the very act, and I could not\n",
      "but admire the cunning with which my friend had inserted a\n",
      "wrong clue in the evening paper, so as to give the fellow the idea\n",
      "that he could continue his scheme with impunity. I was not\n",
      "surprised when Holmes suggested that I should take my revolver\n",
      "with me. He had himself picked up the loaded hunting-crop,\n",
      "which was his favourite weapon.\n",
      "  A four-wheeler was at the door at eleven, and in it we drove\n",
      "to a spot at the other side of Hammersmith Bridge. Here the\n",
      "cabman was directed to wait. A short walk brought us to a\n",
      "secluded road fringed with pleasant houses, each standing in its\n",
      "own grounds. In the light of a street lamp we read \"Laburnum\n",
      "Villa\" upon the gate-post of one of them. The occupants had\n",
      "evidently retired to rest, for all was dark save for a fanlight over\n",
      "the hall door, which shed a single blurred circle on to the garden\n",
      "path. The wooden fence which separated the grounds from the\n",
      "road threw a dense black shadow upon the inner side, and here it\n",
      "was that we crouched.\n",
      "  \"I fear that you'll have a long wait,\" Holmes whispered.\n",
      "\"We may thank our stars that it is not raining. I don't think we\n",
      "can even venture to smoke to pass the time. However, it's a two\n",
      "to one chance that we get something to pay us for our trouble.\"\n",
      "  It proved, however, that our vigil was not to be so long as\n",
      "Holmes had led us to fear, and it ended in a very sudden and\n",
      "singular fashion. In an instant, without the least sound to warn us\n",
      "of his coming, the garden gate swung open, and a lithe, dark\n",
      "figure, as swift and active as an ape, rushed up the garden path.\n",
      "We saw it whisk past the light thrown from over the door and\n",
      "disappear against the black shadow of the house. There was a\n",
      "long pause, during which we held our breath, and then a very\n",
      "gentle creaking sound came to our ears. The window was being\n",
      "opened. The noise ceased, and again there was a long silence.\n",
      "The fellow was making his way into the house. We saw the\n",
      "sudden flash of a dark lantern inside the room. What he sought\n",
      "was evidently not there, for again we saw the flash through\n",
      "another blind. and then through another.\n",
      "  \"Let us get to the open window. We will nab him as he\n",
      "climbs out.\" Lestrade whispered.\n",
      "  But before we could move. the man had emerged again. As he\n",
      "came out into the glimmering patch of light, we saw that he\n",
      "carrled something white under his arm. He looked stealthily all\n",
      "round him. The silence of the deserted street reassured him.\n",
      "Turning his back upon us he laid down his burden, and the next\n",
      "instant there was the sound of a sharp tap, followed by a clatter\n",
      "and rattle. The man was so intent upon what he was doing that\n",
      "he never heard our steps as we stole across the grass plot. With\n",
      "the bound of a tiger Holmes was on his back, and an instant later\n",
      "Lestrade and I had him by either wrist, and the handcuffs had\n",
      "been fastened. As we turned him over I saw a hideous, sallow\n",
      "face, with writhing, furious features. glaring up at us, and I\n",
      "knew that it was indeed the man of the photograph whom we had\n",
      "secured.\n",
      "  But it was not our prisoner to whom Holmes was giving his\n",
      "attention. Squatted on the doorstep, he was engaged in most\n",
      "carefully examining that which the man had brought from the\n",
      "house. It was a bust of Napoleon. Iike the one which we had\n",
      "seen that morning, and it had been broken into similar frag-\n",
      "ments. Carefully Holmes held each separate shard to the light,\n",
      "but in no way did it differ from any other shattered piece of\n",
      "plaster. He had just completed his examination when the hall\n",
      "lights flew up, the door opened, and the owner of the house, a\n",
      "jovial, rotund figure in shirt and trousers, presented himseli.\n",
      "  \"Mr. Josiah Brown, I suppose?\" said Holmes.     \n",
      "  \"Yes, sir and you, no doubt, are Mr. Sherlock Holmes? I had\n",
      "the note which you sent by the express messenger, and I did\n",
      "exactly what you told me. We locked every door on the inside\n",
      "and awaited developments. Well, I'm very glad to see that you\n",
      "have got the rascal. I hope, gentlemen, that you will come in and\n",
      "have some refreshment.\"\n",
      "  However, Lestrade was anxious to get his man into safe\n",
      "quarters, so within a few minutes our cab had bcen summoned\n",
      "and we were all tour upon our way to London. Not a word\n",
      "would our captive say. but he glared at us from thc shadow of\n",
      "his matted hair. and once. when my hand seemed within his\n",
      "reach, he snapped at it like a hungry wolf. We stayed long\n",
      "enough at the police-station to learn that a search of his clothing\n",
      "revealed nothing save a few shillings and a long sheath knife, the\n",
      "handle of which bore copious traces of recent blood.\n",
      "  \"That's all right,\" said Lestrade, as we parted. \"Hill knows\n",
      "all these gentry, and he will give a name to him. You'll find that\n",
      "my theory of the Mafia will work out all right. But I'm sure I am\n",
      "exceedingly obliged to you, Mr. Holmes, for the workmanlike\n",
      "way in which you laid hands upon him. I don't quite understand\n",
      "it all yet.\"\n",
      "  \"I fear it is rather too late an hour for explanations,\" said\n",
      "Holmes. \"Besides, there are one or two details which are not\n",
      "finished off, and it is one of those cases which are worth\n",
      "working out to the very end. If you will come round once more\n",
      "to my rooms at six o'clock to-morrow, I think I shall be able to\n",
      "show you that even now you have not grasped the entire meaning\n",
      "of this business, which presents some features which make it\n",
      "absolutely original in the history of crime. If ever I permit you to\n",
      "chronicle any more of my little problems, Watson, I foresee that\n",
      "you will enliven your pages by an account of the singular\n",
      "adventure of the Napoleonic busts.\"\n",
      "  When we met again next evening, Lestrade was furnished with\n",
      "much information concerning our prisoner. His name, it ap-\n",
      "peared, was Beppo, second name unknown. He was a well-\n",
      "known ne'er-do-well among the Italian colony. He had once\n",
      "been a skilful sculptor and had earned an honest living, but he\n",
      "had taken to evil courses and had twice already been in jail --\n",
      "once for a petty theft, and once, as we had already heard, for\n",
      "stabbing a fellow-countryman. He could talk English perfectly\n",
      "well. His reasons for destroying the busts were still unknown,\n",
      "and he refused to answer any questions upon the subject, but the\n",
      "police had discovered that these same busts might very well have\n",
      "been made by his own hands, since he was engaged in this class\n",
      "of work at the establishment of Gelder & Co. To all this infor-\n",
      "mation, much of which we already knew, Holmes listened with\n",
      "polite attention, but I, who knew him so well, could clearly see\n",
      "that his thoughts were elsewhere, and I detected a mixture of\n",
      "mingled uneasiness and expectation beneath that mask which he\n",
      "was wont to assume. At last he started in his chair, and his eyes\n",
      "brightened. There had been a ring at the bell. A minute later we\n",
      "heard steps upon the stairs, and an elderly red-faced man with\n",
      "grizzled side-whiskers was ushered in. In his right hand he\n",
      "carried an old-fashioned carpet-bag, which he placed upon the\n",
      "table.\n",
      "  \"Is Mr. Sherlock Holmes here?\"\n",
      "  My friend bowed and smiled. \"Mr. Sandeford, of Reading, I\n",
      "suppose?\" said he.\n",
      "  \"Yes, sir, I fear that I am a little late, but the trains\n",
      "were awkward. You wrote to me about a bust that is in my\n",
      "possession.\"\n",
      "  \"Exactly.\"\n",
      "  \"I have your letter here. You said, 'I desire to possess a copy\n",
      "of Devine's Napoleon, and am prepared to pay you ten pounds\n",
      "for the one which is in your possession.' Is that right?\"\n",
      "  \"Certainly.\"\n",
      "  \"I was very much surprised at your letter, for I could not\n",
      "imagine how you knew that I owned such a thing.\"\n",
      "  \"Of course you must have been surprised, but the explanation\n",
      "is very simple. Mr. Harding, of Harding Brothers, said that they\n",
      "had sold you their last copy, and he gave me your address.\"\n",
      "  \"Oh, that was it, was it? Did he tell you what I paid for it?\"\n",
      "  \"No, he did not.\"\n",
      "  \"Well, I am an honest man, though not a very rich one. I only\n",
      "gave fifteen shillings for the bust, and I think you ought to know\n",
      "that before I take ten pounds from you.\"\n",
      "  \"I am sure the scruple does you honour, Mr. Sandeford. But I\n",
      "have named that price, so I intend to stick to it.\"\n",
      "  \"Well, it is very handsome of you, Mr. Holmes. I brought\n",
      "the bust up with me, as you asked me to do. Here it is!\" He\n",
      "opened his bag, and at last we saw placed upon our table a\n",
      "complete specimen of that bust which we had already seen more\n",
      "than once in fragments.\n",
      "  Holmes took a paper from his pocket and laid a ten-pound\n",
      "note upon the table.\n",
      "  \"You will kindly sign that paper, Mr. Sandeford, in the\n",
      "presence of these witnesses. It is simply to say that you transfer\n",
      "every possible right that you ever had in the bust to me. I am a\n",
      "methodical man, you see, and you never know what turn events\n",
      "might take afterwards. Thank you, Mr. Sandeford; here is your\n",
      "money, and I wish you a very good evening.\"\n",
      "  When our visitor had disappeared, Sherlock Holmes's move-\n",
      "ments were such as to rivet our attention. He began by taking a\n",
      "clean white cloth from a drawer and laying it over the table.\n",
      "Then he placed his newly acquired bust in the centre of the cloth.\n",
      "Finally, he picked up his hunting-crop and struck Napoleon a\n",
      "sharp blow on the top of the head. The figure broke into frag-\n",
      "ments, and Holmes bent eagerly over the shattered remains. Next\n",
      "instant, with a loud shout of triumph he held up one splinter, in\n",
      "which a round, dark object was fixed like a plum in a pudding.\n",
      "  \"Gentlemen,\" he cried, \"let me introduce you to the famous\n",
      "black pearl of the Borgias.\"\n",
      "  Lestrade and I sat silent for a moment, and then, with a\n",
      "spontaneous impulse, we both broke out clapping, as at the\n",
      "well-wrought crisis of a play. A flush of colour sprang to Holmes's\n",
      "pale cheeks, and he bowed to us like the master dramatist who\n",
      "receives the homage of his audience. It was at such moments that\n",
      "for an instant he ceased to be a reasoning machine, and betrayed\n",
      "his human love for admiration and applause. The same singularly\n",
      "proud and reserved nature which turned away with disdain from\n",
      "popular notoriety was capable of being moved to its depths by\n",
      "spontaneous wonder and praise from a friend.\n",
      "  \"Yes, gentlemen,\" said he, \"it is the most famous pearl now\n",
      "existing in the world, and it has been my good fortune, by a\n",
      "connected chain of inductive reasoning, to trace it from the\n",
      "Prince of Colonna's bedroom at the Dacre Hotel, where it was\n",
      "lost, to the interior of this, the last of the six busts of Napoleon\n",
      "which were manufactured by Gelder & Co., of Stepney. You\n",
      "will remember, Lestrade, the sensation caused by the disappear-\n",
      "ance of this valuable jewel, and the vain efforts of the London\n",
      "police to recover it. I was myself consulted upon the case, but I\n",
      "was unable to throw any light upon it. Suspicion fell upon the\n",
      "maid of the Princess, who was an Italian, and it was proved that\n",
      "she had a brother in London, but we failed to trace any connec-\n",
      "tion between them. The maid's name was Lucretia Venucci, and\n",
      "there is no doubt in my mind that this Pietro who was murdered\n",
      "two nights ago was the brother. I have been looking up the dates\n",
      "in the old files of the paper, and I find that the disappearance of\n",
      "the pearl was exactly two days before the arrest of Beppo, for\n",
      "some crime of violence -- an event which took place in the\n",
      "factory of Gelder & Co., at the very moment when these busts\n",
      "were being made. Now you clearly see the sequence of events,\n",
      "though you see them, of course, in the inverse order to the way\n",
      "in which they presented themselves to me. Beppo had the pearl\n",
      "in his possession. He may have stolen it from Pietro, he may\n",
      "have been Pietro's confederate, he may have been the go-between\n",
      "of Pietro and his sister. It is of no consequence to us which is the\n",
      "correct solution.\n",
      "  \"The main fact is that he had the pearl, and at that moment,\n",
      "when it was on his person, he was pursued by the police. He\n",
      "made for the factory in which he worked, and he knew that he\n",
      "had only a few minutes in which to conceal this enormously\n",
      "valuable prize, which would otherwise be found on him when he\n",
      "was searched. Six plaster casts of Napoleon were drying in the\n",
      "passage. One of them was still soft. In an instant Beppo, a\n",
      "skilful workman, made a small hole in the wet plaster, dropped\n",
      "in the pearl, and with a few touches covered over the aperture\n",
      "once more. It was an admirable hiding-place. No one could\n",
      "possibly find it. But Beppo was condemned to a year's imprison-\n",
      "ment, and in the meanwhile his six busts were scattered over\n",
      "London. He could not tell which contained his treasure. Only by\n",
      "breaking them could he see. Even shaking would tell him noth-\n",
      "ing, for as the plaster was wet it was probable that the pearl\n",
      "would adhere to it -- as, in fact, it has done. Beppo did not\n",
      "despair, and he conducted his search with considerable ingenuity\n",
      "and perseverance. Through a cousin who works with Gelder, he\n",
      "found out the retail firms who had bought the busts. He managed\n",
      "to find employment with Morse Hudson, and in that way tracked\n",
      "down three of them. The pearl was not there. Then, with the\n",
      "help of some Italian employe, he succeeded in finding out where\n",
      "the other three busts had gone. The first was at Harker's. There\n",
      "he was dogged by his confederate, who held Beppo responsible\n",
      "for the loss of the pearl, and he stabbed him in the scuffle which\n",
      "followed.\"\n",
      "  \"If he was his confederate, why should he carry his photo-\n",
      "graph?\" I asked.\n",
      "  \"As a means of tracing him, if he wished to inquire about him\n",
      "from any third person. That was the obvious reason. Well, after\n",
      "the murder I calculated that Beppo would probably hurry rather\n",
      "than delay his movements. He would fear that the police would\n",
      "read his secret, and so he hastened on before they should get\n",
      "ahead of him. Of course, I could not say that he had not found\n",
      "the pearl in Harker's bust. I had not even concluded for certain\n",
      "that it was the pearl, but it was evident to me that he was looking\n",
      "for something, since he carried the bust past the other houses in\n",
      "order to break it in the garden which had a lamp overlooking it.\n",
      "Since Harker's bust was one in three, the chances were exactly\n",
      "as I told you -- two to one against the pearl being inside it There\n",
      "remained two busts, and it was obvious that he would go for the\n",
      "London one first. I warned the inmates of the house, so as to\n",
      "avoid a second tragedy, and we went down, with the happiest\n",
      "results. By that time, of course, I knew for certain that it was the\n",
      "Borgia pearl that we were after. The name of the murdered man\n",
      "linked the one event with the other. There only remained a single\n",
      "bust -- the Reading one -- and the pearl must be there. I bought it\n",
      "in your presence from the owner -- and there it lies.\"\n",
      "  We sat in silence for a moment.\n",
      "  \"Well,\" said Lestrade, \"I've seen you handle a good many\n",
      "cases, Mr. Holmes, but I don't know that I ever knew a more\n",
      "workmanlike one than that. We're not jealous of you at Scotland\n",
      "Yard. No, sir, we are very proud of you, and if you come down\n",
      "to-morrow, there's not a man, from the oldest inspector to the\n",
      "youngest constable, who wouldn't be glad to shake you by the\n",
      "hand.\"\n",
      "  \"Thank you!\" said Holmes. \"Thank you!\" and as he turned\n",
      "away, it seemed to me that he was more nearly moved by the\n",
      "softer human emotions than I had ever seen him. A moment later\n",
      "he was the cold and practical thinker once more. \"Put the pearl\n",
      "in the safe, Watson,\" said he, \"and get out the papers of the\n",

      "\n",
      "   Once upon a time years and years ago in Baghdad there lived a porter called\n",
      "Sinbad. As he was passing a palace one day, he saw a bench in the great \n",
      "doorway and thought he would rest on it. So he put down his load, and was \n",
      "about to sit down when curiosity got the better of him and, slipping through \n",
      "the entrance he went into the gardens. To Sinbad it was like heaven.\n",
      "   Everywhere there were flower beds, gushing fountains and palm trees, in \n",
      "whose shade many gentlemen were strolling. while pages served them with cakes\n",
      "and drinks. Sinbad couldn't help exclaiming aloud:\n",
      "   \"Well I never! Here I am, worked to the bone, poor and always hungry while \n",
      "other lucky men never carry burdens, but enjoy good food and drink. And yet, \n",
      "we're all Allah's sons! What a world of difference between me and the people \n",
      "who live here.\" Sinbad had barely stopped speaking when one of the pages came \n",
      "across to him and said:\n",
      "   \"Come with me. My master wishes to speak to you.\" Rather alarmed, Sinbad \n",
      "followed the lad into a hall where the owner of the house was seated amongst \n",
      "his guests.\n",
      "   \"Come in,\" he said. \"What's your name?\"\n",
      "   \"Sinbad, the Porter.\"\n",
      "   \"My name is Sinbad too. Sinbad the Sailor. I hear you've been complaining, \n",
      "but I'd like you to know that I became rich only by working hard and taking \n",
      "dreadful risks. All this during seven amazing but adventurous voyages. I \n",
      "haven't had an easy life, you know. Sit down and I'll tell you my story.\"\n",
      "   \"My father,\" began Sinbad the Sailor, \"was a merchant. When he died, he \n",
      "left me a fortune. I was young then and foolish, and I started to squander my \n",
      "riches until one day, I discovered my money had gone. I didn't lose heart, \n",
      "however, for I decided to become a merchant like my father. With the money I \n",
      "earned from selling my furniture and carpets I bought all the goods I could \n",
      "and set out. I boarded a ship at Bassora with other traders and began to trade\n",
      "in every port. One day, the captain dropped anchor near a beautiful island and\n",
      "we went ashore. We had hardly lit the fires to cook our meal when the captain \n",
      "suddenly shouted;\n",
      "   'Quick! Get away! This is no island. It's a huge fish that's been sleeping \n",
      "on the waves so long that trees have grown on it. The heat from the fires is \n",
      "wakening it. It will dive to the deep any minute now. Back to the ship! Drop \n",
      "everything!'\n",
      "   Many managed to climb aboard again, but I was too far away and ended up in \n",
      "the sea. Luckily I found a floating empty barrel. Clinging to this and \n",
      "drifting with the winds and currents, I reached an island. As I came ashore, I\n",
      "saw a mare tethered to a stump. Then a man appeared and asked me:\n",
      "   'Who are you? Where have you come from?'\n",
      "   'I've been shipwrecked,' I said. The man went on:\n",
      "   'Follow me,' he said and took me to a cave, where he offered me some food. \n",
      "I told him of my adventure and he listened in amazement. I was dying to know \n",
      "why he kept his horse tethered at the shore.\n",
      "   'I used to be one of King Mihragian's grooms' he replied. 'When the moon is\n",
      "full, we tether the mares on the beach so they can meet with the sea horses. \n",
      "The foals that are born are so beautiful there are none like them in the whole\n",
      "world. This is the time of the new moon and the sea stallions arrive. When \n",
      "it's all over, I'll take you to the king. You're very lucky, you know, for \n",
      "you'd have died of hunger on this desert island if you hadn't met me.'\n",
      "   My rescuer introduced me to his friends and they gave me a friendly \n",
      "welcome. Later, back in the city the grooms told the king about my adventure.\n",
      "   'It was Allah's will that you should be saved,' the ruler told me after \n",
      "listening carefully. 'It's your destiny to live a long life.' Because he felt \n",
      "I was under the protection of Allah himself, he showered me with gifts and \n",
      "favours. I was appointed harbourmaster; it was my job to keep a register of \n",
      "all freight in transit and so I found myself in an excellent post.\n",
      "   Just the same, I felt homesick, and every time a ship came in, I asked the \n",
      "captain if he was bound for Baghdad, for I intended to ask him for a passage \n",
      "home. One day, however, as I took a note of the cargo on a ship that had just \n",
      "tied up, I asked:\n",
      "   'Anything else on board?'\n",
      "   'Yes,' replied the captain. 'There's still a certain quantity of goods \n",
      "aboard. The owner was lost at sea and must have drowned. I'm going to see if I\n",
      "can sell them and take the money back to his family in Baghdad.'\n",
      "   'What was the name of the man who was lost?' I enquired.\n",
      "   'Sinbad the Sailor.' I let out a shout.\n",
      "   'I am Sinbad the Sailor! I clung to a barrel that saved my life and drifted\n",
      "ashore on an island. There, thanks be to Allah, I met the royal grooms. And it\n",
      "was the king himself who made me harbourmaster. The goods you're carrying on \n",
      "board your ship belong to me.'\n",
      "   'Well, what a story! I've never heard anything like it!' exclaimed the \n",
      "captain. 'Isn't there an honest soul left in the world?'\n",
      "   'Captain!' I gasped. 'Why won't you believe what I say?'\n",
      "   'Because it's perfectly obvious,' he replied, 'that you heard the trader \n",
      "had drowned and now, by inventing a ridiculous adventure, you hope to lay \n",
      "hands on his property!' At that point, I described to the captain every single\n",
      "thing that had taken place on board his ship since the moment it had weighed \n",
      "anchor. He was forced to believe I was telling the truth.\n",
      "   'Good gracious!' everyone gasped. 'We certainly never dreamt that you were \n",
      "safe and sound.'\n",
      "   I got my trading goods back and immediately thought of something precious \n",
      "to give to the king. He was astounded at what had happened, but everyone \n",
      "assured him that every word was true. He too gave me a gift and allowed me to \n",
      "leave with all my belongings. I went aboard. Some days later, I was at \n",
      "Bassora and then back to Baghdad. I had grown far richer than before and \n",
      "quickly forgot all my past suffering.\"\n",
      "   When Sinbad the Sailor had ended his tale, he gave Sinbad the Porter three \n",
      "gold coins and told him to return the next day.\n",
      "   The following day, after providing the porter and the other guests with a \n",
      "delicious meal, Sinbad the Sailor again began to speak.\n",
      "   \"One day, I again had a great desire to travel. I decided to invest some of\n",
      "my money in trading goods and went on board ship at Bassora for my second \n",
      "voyage. To begin with, it was a pleasant journey. Then one day, we reached a \n",
      "strange desert island. Many of the passengers decided to go ashore and I sat \n",
      "down on the bank of a river and fell fast asleep. When I awoke there was not a\n",
      "soul in sight. The ship had sailed, for the captain had forgot all about me.\n",
      "   However, I decided to climb a tree and survey the island. It was then that \n",
      "I discovered a great white dome.\n",
      "   Full of hope, I marched in the direction of the dome. but as I drew near, I\n",
      "realised it had no doors. The sun had not yet set and the sky was a fiery \n",
      "pink. Suddenly, everything went dark, as though night had fallen. I looked up \n",
      "and saw an enormous bird with outstretch wings, shutting out the sunlight. I \n",
      "remembered then of hearing about a bird so huge it fed its nestlings \n",
      "elephants. The bird's name was Rukh. Just then I realised that the dome was \n",
      "really one of Rukh's eggs. Indeed, the great bird settled on top of the egg \n",
      "and dropped of t6o sleep. I unwound my turban and twisted it to make a rope. I\n",
      "tied the end of it round the bird's leg so that it would carry me away with \n",
      "it. At the first light of dawn, the bird woke, spread its immense wings and \n",
      "took flight. So high did it rise into the sky that the earth almost vanished \n",
      "from sight, but it landed on a plateau. I undid the knot. Rukh floated down\n",
      "into the valley below and when he returned, it was with a large snake in his \n",
      "beak. Nobody lived on this plateau and, on the other side of the valley lay a \n",
      "mountain far too high for anyone ever to climb.\n",
      "   All I could do was clamber down into the valley. When I got there, I saw \n",
      "the ground was littered with diamonds and full of terrible snakes. I couldn't \n",
      "help shuddering. Luckily, the snakes were not moving about that day, for fear \n",
      "of Rukh, but darkness was about to fall. I found a cave and blocked the \n",
      "entrance with a rock.\n",
      "   In the morning, I left the cave and started to roam the valley searching \n",
      "for a way out. Suddenly I came upon the carcass of an animal. Just then I \n",
      "remembered once hearing the story of a doomed valley, into which diamond \n",
      "hunters would throw a large dead animal. The precious gems stuck to the \n",
      "carcass and the hunters would then wait for a vulture or eagle to appear. The \n",
      "bird of prey would swoop down on the meat and carry it away in its talons to \n",
      "the plateau above. There, the diamond hunters, shouting and yelling, forced \n",
      "the bird to give up its prey. With this tale in mind, I filled my pockets with\n",
      "diamonds then roped myself to the dead animal.\n",
      "   A little later, a huge eagle carried the carcass and me to the plateau. It \n",
      "was just about to tear into the flesh with its beak, when some men appeared, \n",
      "shouting loudly. The eagle flapped away and, though my clothes were \n",
      "bloodstained, I was alive!\n",
      "   I told the diamond hunters about my adventure and gave some diamonds to the\n",
      "man who had thrown the carcass into the valley. They all told me I was under \n",
      "Allah's own protection. I had come out alive from the valley of the snakes; \n",
      "something nobody else had ever done before. Next day, I set off homewards. I \n",
      "bartered some of the diamonds for goods to sell and became richer than ever. \n",
      "When I arrived in Baghdad, my friends and relations welcomed me with delight \n",
      "and, again forgetting all my trials and troubles, I went back to an easy life.\n",
      "And that's the tale of my second voyage.\n",
      "   I'll tell you about the third tomorrow. It's time to eat now,\" ended Sinbad\n",
      "the Sailor.\n",
      "   Sinbad the bearer of burdens had, like all those present, listened \n",
      "wide-eyed to this story, and again that evening, he found himself gifted \n",
      "another three gold coins. Of course, next day, he hurried back to the sailor's\n",
      "home. He sat at his side till the rich man's friends came, then they sat down \n",
      "to a cheerful feast. When the meal was over, Sinbad the Sailor told the tale \n",
      "of his third voyage.\n",
      "   \"Rich as I was, I wanted to become even richer. So I got a passage again at\n",
      "Bassora, on a fine vessel, together with other merchants.\n",
      "   One day, we ran into a fierce storm and the captain began to cry:\n",
      "   'The ship is out of control! The sails are in tatters! Let's hope we can \n",
      "find shelter in the lee of Monkey Mountain. Though the monkeys are dangerous\n",
      "beasts!`\n",
      "   Shortly after this, the ship ran aground on the shore of a strange island \n",
      "and, in next to no time. we were surrounded by a tribe of monkeys. About the \n",
      "height of a child, hairy and smelly, they rushed about as we stood there \n",
      "without moving a muscle, afraid of what they might do. All we could do was \n",
      "stand aside and watch them swarm up the masts and tear the rubber lifeboats \n",
      "with their sharp teeth.\n",
      "   Soon after, a giant wave swept the vessel out to sea, with the horrid \n",
      "creatures still aboard, together with all our cargo. As we wandered over the \n",
      "island, we caught sight of a huge castle-like building. Though very much \n",
      "afraid, we ventured through the gateway. The castle looked deserted, but \n",
      "somebody certainly lived there for, in the middle of the courtyard stood a \n",
      "large bench and a bonfire of logs was ablaze.\n",
      "   We all sank on to the bench and, overcome by fatigue, fell fast asleep. As \n",
      "evening came the ground began to tremble. A terrifying creature was \n",
      "approaching us. It was a real ogre, gigantic with fierce red eyes, long fangs \n",
      "like those of a wild pig, a great mouth and huge ears. The ogre grabbed me and\n",
      "started to prod me with his enormous hands. Luckily I was too skinny for his \n",
      "taste, so he picked out the plumpest of my companions, killed and made a meal \n",
      "of him. After this meal, he stretched out on the bench and slept whiie we \n",
      "shrank trembling in a corner, unable to sleep a wink. Next morning, the giant \n",
      "went off after locking the door behind him. For us it was a day of terror and \n",
      "the giant, when he returned, picked out another of our little band and made a \n",
      "meal of him too. As soon as he had fallen asleep, we came to a decision:\n",
      "   'We must kill him while he's asleep!' So we put two long sticks into the \n",
      "coals and when they were burning hot, thrust them into the giant's eyes. The \n",
      "ogre leapt to his feet with a scream, knocking us over as he did. Now blinded,\n",
      "he was quite unable to catch us. He fumbled his way to the door and stumbled \n",
      "out, screaming horribly as he went. We ran as fast as we could down to the sea\n",
      "and hastily made a raft out of pieces of driftwood. The raft was barely in the\n",
      "water when we saw the giant coming, with an even more horrible-looking \n",
      "giantess.\n",
      "   They started to hurl great rocks at us, and we were hit more than once. \n",
      "Before we could escape their reach, they had managed to kill all my companions\n",
      "except two. Though by now the raft was scarcely afloat, it carried all three \n",
      "of us to another island. Not knowing where we were, we roamed all day, meeting\n",
      "no-one at all, and fell sound asleep when night fell.\n",
      "   It was not a peaceful night, however. A giant snake crept up and gobbled \n",
      "down one of my friends. Then it curled up and went to sleep. Shaking with \n",
      "terror, my remaining companion and I climbed a tree. Thinking he was sure to \n",
      "be safe there, my friend settled down in the lowest forked branch. This was to\n",
      "save my life. For the snake later finding the poor man an easy victim, ate him\n",
      "up rather than climb to the top of the tree for me. I didn't see how I could \n",
      "ever get away from this place alive. However, I had an idea. Picking up the \n",
      "planks lying round about, I tied one under my feet, another on each side, one \n",
      "along my stomach, another at my back and the last as a roof over my head. This\n",
      "gave me a sort of armour. When, late that night, the snake did its best to \n",
      "devour me, it could not, no matter how hard it tried. My wooden armour \n",
      "withstood the crushing. The reptile squeezed and squeezed till dawn. but as \n",
      "the sun came up, it wearily gave up and slithered away. I untied the planks \n",
      "and set off in search of food. My wanderings took me to the tip of the island,\n",
      "high above the sea. As I sat there, downhearted, staring at the water, I saw a\n",
      "ship sail past only a few hundred yards from the shore. The crew heard my \n",
      "cries and I was safe at last. I was hoisted aboard, fed and clothed and later \n",
      "I told them my amazing tale, which naturally astonished those who heard it. A \n",
      "fair wind swept us safely into the port of Salahita.\n",
      "   The captain then said to me:\n",
      "   'You're a poor unfortunate stranger here, but I'd like to give you another \n",
      "chance. This ship is carrying a batch of goods belonging to one of the \n",
      "passengers who vanished on a desert island. Nothing has ever been heard of him\n",
      "again. I'm going to sell these articles and take the money back to his family.\n",
      "If you like, you can try selling them. I'll give you a commission on what you \n",
      "manage to sell.'\n",
      "   I thanked the captain for his kindness; I was desperately in need. However,\n",
      "the bosun who was busy listing the cargo, asked a question:\n",
      "   'Captain,' he said, 'what name do I put on these goods?'\n",
      "   'Mark them as Sinbad the Sailor's. That's the name of the man who \n",
      "disappeared. '\n",
      "   'But I'm Sinbad the Sailor!' I exclaimed. 'And I didn't disappear at all. I\n",
      "fell asleep on the island and when I awoke, you had all gone. These are my \n",
      "goods. The diamond hunters I met on the mountain, to whom I told my tale, will\n",
      "vouch for all this.'\n",
      "   The crowd of seamen and merchants that had clustered round to listen, began\n",
      "to murmur amongst themselves. Some believed my words, others swore I was a \n",
      "liar. Suddenly, however, on hearing the words 'diamond hunters', one of the \n",
      "merchants came up to me and, after a good stare, exclaimed:\n",
      "   'Do you remember when I told you all about the man roped to the carcass I \n",
      "threw into Diamond Valley? Well, this is him! I know his face. Everything he \n",
      "says is true.' At that, the captain sharply demanded:\n",
      "   'What marks do your goods have on them? Which are they?' I told him and he \n",
      "too realised that I was none other than Sinbad. That's how I got my belongings\n",
      "back and was able to go on trading as though nothing had happened. When I\n",
      "returned home, I saw that I was even richer than before. That's all I have to \n",
      "tell about my third voyage,\" Sinbad said, \"but if you come back tomorrow, I'll\n",
      "describe the fourth one.\"\n",
      "   Thus saying, he ordered that the bearer of burdens should be given three \n",
      "gold coins. Next morning, Sinbad the Porter hurried back to his rich friend. \n",
      "They enjoyed a meal and waited till all the other guests had appeared. Then \n",
      "Sinbad the Sailor started to tell the story of his fourth adventure.\n",
      "   \"As in the past, I began to feel the urge to travel, and I knew I had to go\n",
      "back to sea. I bought a great quantity of goods, said goodbye and went to \n",
      "Bassora to find a ship. To begin with, the voyage was all plain sailing. Till \n",
      "the day a hurricane ripped the sails and broke up the ship. We all ended in \n",
      "the sea, though most of us were able to cling to bits of wreckage and keep \n",
      "afloat. Then the waters grew calm again and the waves washed us ashore on an \n",
      "island. Our first thought was to look for food and as we did so, we came upon \n",
      "a building. A band of naked men rushed out, without uttering a sound and shut \n",
      "us up in a large pen. They brought us such strange food that I, who did not \n",
      "trust them, refused to eat. But, overcome by hunger, my friends gobbled it \n",
      "down. This was to lead to their ruin, for the more they ate, as though by \n",
      "magic, the hungrier they felt.\n",
      "   In horror, I realised that the naked men were the subjects of an ogre. They\n",
      "caught shipwrecked sailors, fattened them up with special food and then when \n",
      "they were nice and plump, strangled and roasted them. While my friends, \n",
      "already out of their minds, were led to pasture just like farm animals, I \n",
      "began to starve. By the time I was nothing but skin and bone, nobody was \n",
      "paying the slightest attention to me and I took the opportunity to run away.\n",
      "   For seven days and seven nights I walked without stopping. At dawn on the \n",
      "eighth day, in the distance I could see folk picking peppers. They took pity \n",
      "on me and led me to their king. I told His Majesty everything that had \n",
      "happened since the day I left Baghdad, and feeling sorry for me, the king \n",
      "presented me with a silver coin. I decided to stay in that hospitable city. It\n",
      "was easy to make friends with the citizens, and they soon had great respect \n",
      "for me. One day, I noticed that everyone the rich and the poor, always rode \n",
      "bareback. Surprised at this I mentioned it to the king and he asked\n",
      "   'What is a saddle like?'\n",
      "   'Have I your permission to make one?' I asked him.\n",
      "   'If you wish,' he replied, ordering his servants to provide me with \n",
      "everything I required. A skilled carpenter built the wooden shape, stuffed it \n",
      "with wool and covered it with leather. A blacksmith forged the stirrups. Then \n",
      "I strapped the saddle on a horse's back and persuaded the king to try riding \n",
      "it. He was so delighted that he gave me a generous reward for my work. A few \n",
      "days later, I had a visit from the Prime Minister. He too wanted a saddle, and\n",
      "in the end, so did many other important officials at Court. I set to work at \n",
      "making saddles for them all and quickly became wealthy.\n",
      "   As time went by, my reputation grew, and the king sent for me one day.\n",
      "   'You are now highly respected and well loved by all here. But what you need\n",
      "is a wife. I wish you to marry the young lady I've chosen for you.' And this I\n",
      "did willingly, for she was rich and beautiful. I was perfectly happy with my \n",
      "wife and lived in peace.\n",
      "   'If I ever go home,' I said to myself, 'I'll take her with me.' But a man's\n",
      "fate is always a mystery.\n",
      "   A little time later, I went to visit one of my neighbours. His wife had \n",
      "died and he was desperate.\n",
      "   'My good friend,' I consoled him, 'don't torment yourself like this. You've\n",
      "still a life to live. Maybe you'll get married again and find a wife that is \n",
      "even better than your first one!'\n",
      "   'How do you expect me to remarry,' the man replied, 'when I've only one \n",
      "more day to live!'\n",
      "   'What? But you're perfectly healthy! '\n",
      "   'I know,' he said, 'but I shall be buried along with my wife today. That's \n",
      "our custom.' And as we were speaking, in came the man's friends and relations.\n",
      "The dead woman was gently laid in her coffin and carried to the foot of a hill\n",
      "by the sea shore. There the gravediggers lifted up a great stone, revealing a \n",
      "deep pit. Once the coffin had been lowered into the pit, the widower was \n",
      "obliged to follow it down, taking with him nothing but a jug of water and \n",
      "seven pieces of bread. I cried,\n",
      "   'That's a fate worse than death,` I hurried straight to the king. 'How can \n",
      "anyone be so cruel as to bury the living with the dead?' I asked him.\n",
      "   'It isn't cruel,' he replied. 'This custom has been followed since the dawn\n",
      "of time.'\n",
      "   'Do strangers suffer the same fate?' I asked him.\n",
      "   'Yes. It touches all who live in this land and have married here.'\n",
      "   I was aghast. This meant that my life would be linked to my wife's, and if \n",
      "she were to die, I would be buried with her. By sheer ill luck wife did fall \n",
      "ill some time after and died only a few days later. Her relatives arrived, \n",
      "dressed her, adorning her with all her jewellery, then laid her in her coffin.\n",
      "They firmly gripped me and though I struggled and protested, I was lowered \n",
      "into the pit. The stone clanged back into place over my head. Wild with \n",
      "terror, I fainted. When I came to my senses I could see, with the aid of a \n",
      "feeble light filtering from a tiny crack, that I was in a vast cavern. All \n",
      "around, amongst broken coffins, lay skeletons covered with jewels. Horror gave\n",
      "way to madness. I started to gather up the precious stones, without thinking \n",
      "that I would never be able to take them out, for this place was to be my own \n",
      "tomb. Overcome by desperation, I screamed, wept and swore, before dropping \n",
      "exhausted by the wall of the cavern.\n",
      "   The days passed. I had carefully rationed my bread and water to make it \n",
      "last. I soon lost all notion of time and had no idea how long I had been down \n",
      "this pit. Yet a small ray of hope shone within me. I had survived so many \n",
      "other adventures and trials that it seemed impossible that I should die now. \n",
      "One day, the noise of rolling stones wakened me from sleep. I leapt to my feet\n",
      "and rushed towards the spot the sound seemed to come from. There I saw a huge \n",
      "badger which, alarmed at my sudden arrival, fled along a tunnel. I followed it\n",
      "and after crawling for what seemed an eternity, caught sight of light: it was \n",
      "the hole in the rock through which the badger had entered.\n",
      "   In the open air again, I found myself halfway up the hillside. Fresh air at\n",
      "last! I felt as though I had been given a new lease of life. However, I went \n",
      "back along the tunnel to the cavern and stripped the dead of the jewels they \n",
      "would never need again.\n",
      "   On the shore I managed to catch some lobsters and other molluscs. The days \n",
      "went by, and at last I saw a ship. I rushed to the top of the hill and waved a\n",
      "white cloth. Luckily someone saw it and a lifeboat was lowered into the water.\n",
      "I was soon aboard, safe and sound. The ship continued on its way. It was an \n",
      "uneventful voyage, and some days later, I returned to Baghdad and my family \n",
      "and friends. And that,\" said Sinbad, \"is what happened to me on my fourth sea \n",
      "voyage.\"\n",
      "   With that, the sailor fell silent and his guests remarked in tones of \n",
      "wonder about their host's adventures. It was late when the porter rose to his \n",
      "feet to leave, and again he found three gold coins slipped into his hand.\n",
      "   At the first light of dawn next day, Sinbad the Porter went to the house of\n",
      "Sinbad the Sailor, who began to tell another tale.\n",
      "   \"I was as good as dead more than once during my fourth voyage, but I soon \n",
      "forgot the risks I had run. I began to feel the wanderlust again. This time I \n",
      "bought a ship, signed on a captain and loaded it with cargo. We sailed and \n",
      "traded from one island to another, till one day, we dropped anchor in a bay of\n",
      "a desert island. Far in the distance I could see a white dome. It was a huge \n",
      "egg. That's when I knew I had landed on Rukh's island. Though I warned the \n",
      "merchants not to, they broke the egg and took out the chick. Just as they were\n",
      "about to cook it, the sky grew very dark. Rukh's wings had blotted out the \n",
      "sun. We all ran back to the ship and I shouted to cast off immediately. When \n",
      "Rukh saw that the egg was broken, off he flew in search of his mate.\n",
      "   In a very short time, the two great birds came back, circled above the ship\n",
      "for a moment or two, then flapped away. We were well out to sea when we \n",
      "spotted the birds, each gripping a boulder in its talons. The captain managed \n",
      "to swerve and avoid Rukh's rock, but the second boulder scored a direct hit \n",
      "on the prow, smashing it to bits. The ship sank like a stone.\n",
      "   As luck would have it, fate floated a spar towards me and clinging to this,\n",
      "I was washed by the tide onto an island beach. I found myself in an immense \n",
      "garden of Eden, thickly planted with fruit trees and full of sparkling \n",
      "streams. After wandering through this garden for a while, I came upon an old \n",
      "man dressed in leaves, beside a spring. Thinking he must be another \n",
      "shipwrecked sailor, I went over to him.\n",
      "   Without saying a word, the old man gestured that he wanted to go into the \n",
      "nearby forest, but was unable to walk. So I hoisted him onto my shoulders. \n",
      "However, when we reached the spot I thought he had pointed to, he refused to \n",
      "get down. What's more, as I tried to shrug him off my back, he squeezed his \n",
      "legs so tightly round my neck, I almost choked. I fell to the ground and the \n",
      "stranger began to kick me with an energy that was amazing in one so old and so\n",
      "small. Then I realised I was at his mercy. Indeed, by dint of kicking, he made\n",
      "me carry him here and there, without a moments rest. The only time I got any \n",
      "rest was when he fell asleep. But these breaks were very short, for the old \n",
      "fellow would not let me be. Dazed by his blows, I was furious at being so \n",
      "ill-rewarded for my kindness in helping him in the first place.\n",
      "   As I was wandering about one day with the old man on my back, I saw some \n",
      "large water melons in a field. Close by was a vineyard, the vines laden with \n",
      "grapes. I decided I could easily make some wine. The old man said he did not \n",
      "mind and let me get on with the job. Several days later, the grapes had \n",
      "fermented and when the old fellow saw me happily tasting the wine, he snatched\n",
      "the gourd from my hands and drained it dry. A little later, he was flat on the\n",
      "ground, helplessly drunk. I kicked him then as hard as I could and ran off.\n",
      "   A few days after this, a storm drove a ship into the bay, where she dropped\n",
      "anchor. I was taken aboard, given fresh clothes and a meal. When the storm had\n",
      "passed, the ship set sail and some weeks later we reached the monkey town. \n",
      "This strange town got its name from the ferocious monkeys that invaded it \n",
      "every evening. Towards sundown, the citizens were obliged to leave the town, \n",
      "take refuge on ships and other craft and stay away from the shore. Anyone \n",
      "remaining in the town would be killed by these fearsome creatures. Here too I \n",
      "had another stroke of bad luck.\n",
      "   Having left the ship and gone to visit the town, I lingered at the market \n",
      "and my ship left without me. I was roaming about feeling very frightened, for \n",
      "it was almost evening, when a man came over to me.\n",
      "   'Come with me,' he said, 'or the monkeys will get you!' So I went aboard \n",
      "his boat and spent the night out at sea, returning with the rest of the people\n",
      "in the morning. And for the rest of the time I passed on the island, I spent \n",
      "the night on this man's boat. The owner became a friend and he said to me:\n",
      "   'What's your job? What skills do you have?'\n",
      "   'I'm a merchant,' I replied, 'but I can't trade, for I've lost all I had.'\n",
      "   'Take this sack then,' he said 'fill it with stones. Go with these men and \n",
      "do as they do! Maybe you'll manage to make some money.' So I filled the sack \n",
      "with stones and went with the other men to a palm grove on the outskirts of \n",
      "the town, the home of a tribe of monkeys. The men started to throw the stones \n",
      "at the beasts, and from their perches in the treetops, the monkeys threw\n",
      "coconuts. Whether this was in imitation of the men or in self defence, I do \n",
      "not know. But when we had thrown all our stones, we filled the sacks with \n",
      "coconuts. Back in the town, I took my coconut harvest to my friend.\n",
      "   'Sell as many as you need to and store the rest in my warehouse.' I could \n",
      "not thank him enough for his help. Every day I went to the palm grove and came\n",
      "back laden with coconuts. I sold some and stored the rest in the warehouse.\n",
      "   Then one fine day, a ship sailed in. Now was my chance to go home again. I \n",
      "agreed a price with the captain for taking me and my load of coconuts. We set \n",
      "sail immediately, calling at islands and ports, and at all of them I bartered \n",
      "coconuts. On Cinnamon Island I bought cinnamon, on Pepper Island I got a large\n",
      "quantity of pepper. Then we landed on an island where the aloe trees grew. The\n",
      "wood of this tree is the best in the world and I bought a large number of \n",
      "planks. Later, we came to the Pearl Sea. I called the fishermen and promised\n",
      "them many coconuts is they would fish pearls for me. This they did, and they\n",
      "brought me lots of big pearls.\n",
      "   'You have a great fortune there, Sir,' the fishermen exclaimed. Never \n",
      "before had they found so many big pearls all at the one time. With the \n",
      "blessing of Allah, we had an easy trip to Bassora, where I stopped for some \n",
      "time before going on to Baghdad. There I found my home, family and all my \n",
      "friends again. I gave generously, especially to widows and orphans, as I \n",
      "always did. When all was said and done, I had succeeded in gaining nearly four\n",
      "times the amount I had lost. That helped me to quickly forget all my \n",
      "misadventures and I soon dropped back into a carefree, happy-go-lucky life.\n",
      "   \"Go now!\" said Sinbad the Sailor, \"but return tomorrow, and I'll tell you \n",
      "what happened during my sixth voyage.\"\n",
      "   Sinbad the Porter received his usual three gold coins and went off home. \n",
      "Next morning, he returned, and was greeted with Sinbad the Sailor's usual \n",
      "kindliness. When the other guests arrived, there was a cheerful feast and all \n",
      "those present praised the sailor's generosity. After the meal, Sinbad began to\n",
      "tell tale. \n",
      "   \"Well, friends, I was so delighted to be back that my life was a round of \n",
      "parties and festivities. Once more I forgot all my past suffering, fears and \n",
      "brushes with death. One day, certain merchants who had just returned from a \n",
      "long cruise, came to see me, and I was seized with the longing to set out on \n",
      "my travels. So I bought new goods and took a passage on a large ship. It was a\n",
      "peaceful voyage till the day the captain announced in frightened tones:\n",
      "   'The wind has blown us into unknown waters. Anything can happen now, for I \n",
      "have no idea if there are reefs and rocks. I have no charts that show these \n",
      "seas. All we can do is pray to Allah!' Still greatly alarmed, he set the sails\n",
      "to quickly leave behind the uncharted waters. But the wind suddenly veered, so\n",
      "violently that the rudder split apart, leaving us at the mercy of the waves, a\n",
      "short distance from an island surrounded by terrifying rocks.\n",
      "   'There's no hope for us at all!' cried the captain. And a second later, the\n",
      "ship crashed onto the rocks, smashing into a thousand splinters. With one or \n",
      "two others, I managed to cling to a rock. We came later to a wide beach, \n",
      "encircled by a steep mountain. Wreckage from many a shipwreck lay scattered on\n",
      "the shore. Beside the beach, a river flowed for a short distance before \n",
      "disappearing into an opening in the rock. We quickly discovered that things of\n",
      "value were to be found amongst the wrecks and we picked up rubies, pearls, \n",
      "emeralds and diamonds.\n",
      "   Our great fear, however, was of dying of hunger for, though there were a \n",
      "few trees, not one bore any signs of fruit or even a berry to eat. And so, \n",
      "within a few days, everyone had died but myself, and I knew that I could not \n",
      "last long. I decided to dig my own grave.\n",
      "   'If I should feel too weak,' I told myself, 'I shall lay myself down in my \n",
      "coffin and wait for death. Then the wind will blow sand over me and I too will\n",
      "have a proper burial.' I dug the hole, then sat down to await the end, on the \n",
      "bank of the river, cursing my craze for travel. As I gazed at the running \n",
      "water, I suddenly realised that it must be flowing somewhere, perhaps even to \n",
      "a place where people were living. I had to make a raft. With that thought, I \n",
      "set to work using driftwood from the beach. Now, in order to float through the\n",
      "entrance to the rock the raft would have to be short and narrow, so I made it\n",
      "the same length as my own height and found two short sticks as oars. I loaded\n",
      "all the gems I had found and my remaining items of food. Then I shoved it into\n",
      "the water and lay down on it.\n",
      "   The current swept me under the shadow of the rock and into darkness. The \n",
      "raft floated along, brushing the walls of the underground passageway, ready to\n",
      "capsize from one minute to the next. Then the tunnel widened and the raft \n",
      "glided so smoothly and so gently that I fell asleep.\n",
      "   When I awoke, I was back in the open air, lying on the grassy river bank \n",
      "and surrounded by men. Their friendly looks quickly calmed my fears.\n",
      "   'Welcome, brother,' said one of the men as I opened my eyes. 'Where have \n",
      "you come from? Who are you?' I almost shouted at him:\n",
      "   'In the name of all-holy Allah! Give me a bite of food. Then I'll answer \n",
      "all your questions.' At once the kindly people brought me food and drink, and \n",
      "as I gobbled it hungrily, I told them my tale.\n",
      "   'We must take you to our king,' said the men. 'This is an extraordinary \n",
      "story. He'll be interested to hear it.' A few hours later, we were in the \n",
      "city. My new friends had brought the raft too, with its load. The king gave me\n",
      "a splendid welcome, listened to my tale and said how glad he was I had scraped\n",
      "through. Being curious to hear about life in my own land, he asked me to stay \n",
      "as his guest.\n",
      "   'I've learned a lot from you,' he told me. 'The Caliph of Baghdad seems to \n",
      "be a wise ruler. I wish to send him a gift as a token of friendship and \n",
      "respect. I'd like you to take it to him when you return to your own city.'\n",
      "   Not long after, a group of merchants engaged a ship to sail to Bassora. \n",
      "This was my chance. I went to the king and told him I wanted to leave. And \n",
      "with great courtesy, since I was to take his gift to the Caliph of Baghdad, he\n",
      "paid all my travelling expenses.\n",
      "   The moment I reached Baghdad, I called on the Caliph with the gift. He was \n",
      "amazed and wondered why an unknown king should be so generous. So I told him \n",
      "what had happened. I spent almost a whole week at the Caliph's court, for the \n",
      "ruler never tired of hearing me repeat my story. At long last, I was free to \n",
      "return home, and I carefully laid my treasure in my strong boxes. And this is \n",
      "the adventure of the sixth voyage,\" ended Sinbad the Sailor. The porter was \n",
      "handed his three gold coins and off he went. Back he came at sunrise next day,\n",
      "and again Sinbad the Sailor began to recount.\n",
      "   \"As before, I craved to travel after a while. For a long time, we had fair \n",
      "winds. Then one day, a storm blew up, bringing driving rain, like nothing we \n",
      "had ever seen before. But this was not all, for a little later, the captain \n",
      "began to tear his hair in desperation as he cried:\n",
      "   'Pray Allah if we're to be saved! This is the sea of the doomed, from which\n",
      "there is no return.' Then he took a fistful of earth from a box, dampened it \n",
      "with seawater, sniffed it and went on to say:\n",
      "   'Men, this is a strange part of the world we're in, with evil forces. We've\n",
      "no hope of escape. We are close to the land where King Solomon is buried, and \n",
      "the home of huge deadly snakes. Ships here are swallowed by monster fish!' \n",
      "Hardly had the captain said these words than there was a terrible roar, like \n",
      "the sound of a thousand tempests. In a flash a giant fish rose from the deep \n",
      "and swam towards us. We had barely set eyes on this, when a second and then \n",
      "another even more gigantic fish broke the surface of the sea. All three \n",
      "splashed round and round us, then the biggest hurled itself at our ship, its \n",
      "jaws gaping wide to swallow us. At that very instant, a great wave heaved the \n",
      "ship into the air and threw it against the rocks. Everyone on board was \n",
      "knocked into the sea. Gasping for breath, I managed to grab a plank. Then I \n",
      "found I was alone, for all the others had drowned.\n",
      "   'If I get out of here alive,' I cried, 'I swear to Allah that I'll never \n",
      "again leave Baghdad.' For two days and nights I floated in the sea, but on the\n",
      "third day, my feet located dry land. I was on an island, and as I explored it,\n",
      "I came to a river that reminded me of my previous voyage. Perhaps this river \n",
      "too would carry me to safety.\n",
      "   Again I needed a raft, and set about finding suitable bits of wood. \n",
      "Luckily, I laid hands on some precious sandalwood, which is light and floats \n",
      "well. The raft was soon ready and I set off down the river. For two days, \n",
      "everything went smoothly, but on the third day, the current dragged me in the \n",
      "direction of a cave. Terror-stricken, I tried in vain to pole the raft to the \n",
      "bank, but the river carried me into the heart of the mountain. This time the \n",
      "tunnel was not very long, but a series of waterfalls boomed and echoed like \n",
      "thunder and I was battered and beaten by the rushing waters. At long last, \n",
      "after running the risk of being smashed to pieces against the rocks, the river\n",
      "again flowed calmly and carried me along till I came to a city.\n",
      "   By that time I was half dead from hunger and terror. An old man with a \n",
      "white beard took me home and gave me shelter. Some days later, he said to me.\n",
      "   'Come with me, my son, to the market and sell your goods.' I could not \n",
      "understand what he meant. What goods? But I said nothing. Then I discovered \n",
      "that the sandalwood, of which the raft was made, was valuable in that country.\n",
      "And so, I again became rich. The old man grew so fond of me he wanted me to \n",
      "marry his only daughter. I had no choice but to agree. In any case, his \n",
      "daughter was kind and beautiful, as well as rich. Time passed and the old man \n",
      "died. I inherited his worldly goods and also his position as chief of the \n",
      "merchants.\n",
      "   But I quickly made an amazing discovery about some of the inhabitants of \n",
      "the city: on the first day of each month, certain men grew wings, rose into \n",
      "the air and flew far out of sight. The next day, they went back to everyday \n",
      "life.\n",
      "   The first day of the next month, I approached one of the winged men and \n",
      "jumped on his back. Off we flew, higher and higher into the sky, almost \n",
      "touching the vaults of heaven, and I thought I heard the angels sing. Overcome\n",
      "by emotion, I couldn't help calling out:\n",
      "   'Praise and Glory be to Allah!' I had hardly said the last word when a \n",
      "giant tongue of fire leapt from the sky, just missing us by inches. We dived \n",
      "down to the peak of a high mountain and the winged man yelled at me in rage:\n",
      "   'You spoiled everything, praising Allah while we were flying!'\n",
      "   'I never dreamt that it would do any harm,' I replied. 'I'm very sorry. \n",
      "Please take me back to the city.' The man agreed, on condition that I made no \n",
      "mention of Allah while on his back. He took me straight home where my wife, \n",
      "worried at my absence, was delighted to see me. When I told her what had \n",
      "happened, she said:\n",
      "   'You were naive. You mustn't go near these folk. They're brothers to the \n",
      "Devil and hate the name of Allah.'\n",
      "   'What about your father?' I asked.\n",
      "   'My father never had anything to do with them, and never did anything \n",
      "wrong. He wanted me to marry you so there would be no danger of my becoming \n",
      "the wife of a winged man. Why don't you sell everything and let's go together \n",
      "to Baghdad?' I took her advice and some months later, we came home. Here I saw\n",
      "friends and relatives who had given up all hope of ever setting eyes on me \n",
      "again, and they gave us a great homecoming.\n",
      "   Everyone was astonished to hear my story, but all were overjoyed when I \n",
      "swore that I had been on my last voyage. And this was also my last adventure,\"\n",
      "concluded the host.\n",
      "   \"Please excuse me for my complaints when I didn't know you and had no idea \n",
      "how much you had gone through to become rich,\" said Sinbad the Porter. Sinbad \n",
      "the Sailor hugged him and asked him to remain in his house as a guest. And \n",
      "from that day on, Sinbad the Sailor and Sinbad the Porter lived together as \n",
